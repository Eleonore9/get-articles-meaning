 Wholesome food is essential for survival and animals have developed nervous systems that guide food intake. The nervous system senses diverse extrinsic and intrinsic cues, integrates the information and activates muscle movements that are required for food intake. The nervous system also stores past food experiences, which change the pattern of food intake. Dissection of the neural pathways that control food intake is not only a key to stop the epidemic of obesity and eating disorders, but may also provide insight into fundamental problems in neuroscience such as sensory perception and learning and memory. To test if familiarity discrimination alters feeding in C. elegans, we tested if exposure to a particular bacterium alters its subsequent consumption. For this assay, we trained wild-type animals to develop familiarity either to Escherichia coli HB101 (H) or to Pseudomonas DA1878 (D) (also called B7 in our previous study, Avery and Shtonda, 2003) by exposing the animals to one or the other bacterium from the first larval stage (L1) until adulthood (Figure 1A). HB101 and DA1878 are benign bacteria that support the growth of C. elegans at a similar rate (Avery and Shtonda, 2003). Once the animals reached adulthood, we compared feeding rates on previously experienced bacteria (HH and DD groups) to feeding rates on novel bacteria (DH and HD groups) (Figure 1A; see ‘Feeding assay’ and ‘Statistical analysis and data presentation’ in ‘Materials and methods’ for details). We found that the feeding rates of the animals on familiar bacteria were significantly higher than the rates on novel bacteria, regardless of bacterial type (Figure 1B,C). The increased feeding rates on familiar food compared to the rates on novel food persisted 7-8 hr after the training was over, supporting that worms discriminate familiar food from novel food and that recognition of familiar bacteria increases feeding (Figure 1D,E). Consistent with this, the familiar food-induced increase in feeding was not affected by the worm's nutritional status (Figure 1B-E). We then tested if the behavior is selective for the two tested bacteria by repeating the experiment using other benign bacterial strains, Enterobacteria JU54 and Pseudomonas PA14 pstP (Tan et al., 1999) (Figure 2A). Consistent with the idea that mere exposure to any benign bacterium increases subsequent consumption of that bacterium, the feeding rates on familiar bacteria were higher than the rates on novel bacteria, regardless of bacteria type (Figure 2B-E). Finally, we considered the possibility that cultivation on two different bacteria caused the differences in feeding rates on familiar food and novel food by affecting development. If the feeding differences are caused by developmental differences, not familiarity discrimination, an exposure to particular bacteria during adulthood is not expected to cause an increased feeding response to the bacteria. However, 9 hr of exposure to a particular bacterium during adulthood was sufficient to induce a preferential response to that bacterium (Figure 3D,E). In contrast to 9 hr, 6-hr exposure to the training food failed to increase subsequent consumption (Figure 3B,C), suggesting that the behavioral plasticity was determined by the duration of exposure to the training food. These data imply that C. elegans forms a recognition memory of particular bacteria after experience, which allows the worms to discriminate familiar bacteria from novel bacteria, and that the recognition of familiar bacteria increases the feeding response.10.7554/eLife.00329.003Figure 1.Recognition of familiar food increases feeding response in C. elegans.

Here, using the simple animal model C. elegans, we delineate a neural pathway by which food exposure alters later consumption of the food. We first showed that regulation of feeding by familiarity discrimination is conserved in C. elegans by showing that (1) Prior exposure to particular bacteria selectively increases feeding in response to those bacteria; (2) The behavior depends on the duration of exposure, but not on the timing of exposure (Figure 3) or nutritional status (Figure 1B-E); (3) C. elegans retains the memory of familiar bacteria for at least 7 hr (Figure 1D,E and 2B-E). We speculate that the C. elegans nervous system may have evolved this way to increase the probability of consuming wholesome food by using past food experiences as in higher vertebrates and humans. It was previously shown that naïve worms are attracted to the smell of pathogenic bacteria but develop aversion to it after experience (Zhang et al., 2005; Ha et al., 2010). The pathogenic bacteria kill worms in 4 hr (Zhang et al., 2005) and thus, it would be detrimental for worms to increase consumption of the bacteria. Our hypothesis can be tested by testing whether worms increase the feeding response to the pathogenic bacteria after experience. Many questions remain to be answered to fully understand the mechanism underlying recognition of familiar bacteria in C. elegans. How do worms sense different bacteria? What changes in the nervous system underlie the process of becoming familiar to particular bacteria during experience? Further quests to explore these unanswered questions may deepen our understanding of sensory information processing and familiarity discrimination. Except when stated otherwise, C. elegans was cultured at 19°C as described by (Brenner, 1974). Except in Figure 10, all worms used were hermaphrodites. The following mutant alleles were used: mod-1(ok103) V, mod-5(n3314) I, ser-4(ok512) III, ser-7(tm1325) X, tph-1(mg280) II. In the main text only the gene name is shown.

Familiarity discrimination has a significant impact on the pattern of food intake across species. However, the mechanism by which the recognition memory controls feeding is unclear. Here, we show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans forms a memory of particular foods after experience and displays behavioral plasticity, increasing the feeding response when they subsequently recognize the familiar food. We found that recognition of familiar food activates the pair of ADF chemosensory neurons, which subsequently increase serotonin release. The released serotonin activates the feeding response mainly by acting humorally and directly activates SER-7, a type 7 serotonin receptor, in MC motor neurons in the feeding organ. Our data suggest that worms sense the taste and/or smell of novel bacteria, which overrides the stimulatory effect of familiar bacteria on feeding by suppressing the activity of ADF or its upstream neurons. Our study provides insight into the mechanism by which familiarity discrimination alters behavior.
Many species, including our own, show a preference for familiar foods over novel ones. This behavior probably evolved to reduce the risk of consuming items that turn out to be poisonous, but the mechanisms that underlie a preference for familiar foods are largely unknown.
