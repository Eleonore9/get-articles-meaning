 ‘Agranular’ cortical regions such as the primary motor cortex (M1; area 4) are so named as they are commonly held to lack layer 4 (L4) (Brodmann, 1909). The apparent absence of L4 has strongly influenced theories of cortical organization (Shipp, 2005; Bastos et al., 2012; Shipp et al., 2013). Nevertheless, various observations—such as subtle changes in cell density, expression patterns of various molecular markers, branching patterns of thalamocortical axons, and retrograde labeling termination—suggest that motor cortex might contain some sort of L4 homolog (Krieg, 1946; von Bonin, 1949; Caviness, 1975; Deschênes et al., 1979; Skoglund et al., 1997; Cho et al., 2004; Kuramoto et al., 2009; Rowell et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2011; Kaneko, 2013; García-Cabezas and Barbas, 2014). For example, Rorb expression in mouse S1 is highest in L4 (Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 1997) (Figure 1A), and a similar if weaker and thinner pattern is seen in M1 (Figure 1B), coincident with the L3/5A border (Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 1997; Shepherd, 2009; Rowell et al., 2010). In primate M1, Rorb is also expressed but at lower levels than in sensory cortices (Bernard et al., 2012), and a recent report presented evidence for the existence of L4 based on cytoarchitecture and SMI-32 labeling patterns (García-Cabezas and Barbas, 2014).10.7554/eLife.05422.003Figure 1.L4 in M1 as a zone of Rorb expression.Images are from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (http://mouse.brain-map.org/) (Lein et al., 2007) showing coronal sections for Rorb in situ hybridization (probe Rorb-RP_071018_01_H03) and corresponding Nissl stains. (A) S1 labeling. In a Nissl-stained section (left), L4 is readily identifiable due to cell density differences across layers. In situ hybridization labeling of Rorb (center, with corresponding expression intensity image shown on the right) is the strongest in L4 (long arrow, with borders indicated by lines), with weaker labeling present in L5A/B (short arrow). (B) M1 labeling. Nissl stain (left) showing a region of the lateral agranular cortex corresponding to the forelimb representation area of M1 (same section as in panel A). L4 is not readily identifiable based on cell density differences alone. Nevertheless, in situ hybridization against Rorb (center and right) shows the strongest labeling in a laminar zone corresponding to L4 in S1 (long arrow, with borders indicated by lines), with weaker labeling present in L5A/B (short arrow). Scale on the far right shows the normalized cortical distance from pia to white matter (WM). The approximate location of the cortical layers is indicated, based on prior quantitative analysis of the bright-field optical appearance of M1 layers (Weiler et al., 2008).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05422.003 In sensory cortical areas, L4 neurons receive strong thalamocortical (TC) excitation from primary sensory thalamic nuclei (Douglas and Martin, 2004; Feldmeyer, 2012; Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013). If the Rorb-expressing zone in M1 is similarly organized, then neurons in that laminar location should receive strong TC input from the primary motor thalamic nuclei, particularly the ventrolateral nucleus (VL). This is suggested by previous anatomical work (Strick and Sterling, 1974; Jones, 1975; Cho et al., 2004; Kuramoto et al., 2009; Kaneko, 2013); however, while monosynaptic VL input to pyramidal neurons in the upper layers of vibrissal M1 was recently demonstrated using an optogenetic-electrophysiological approach (Hooks et al., 2013), it was not possible to determine if this input terminated in a putative L4 or L2/3, as vibrissal M1 is highly compressed due to its location at a cortical flexure (von Economo, 1929; Hooks et al., 2011). We tested the hypothesis that M1, despite lacking a cytoarchitecturally distinct granular layer, nevertheless contains the circuit-level equivalent of L4 in the form of a layer of excitatory neurons at the layer 3/5A border having the same basic synaptic circuit organization as L4 neurons in sensory cortex. Our findings support this hypothesis and additionally reveal area-specific features of these M1-L4 neurons. Animal studies were approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. In vivo stereotaxic injections of retrograde tracers (fluorescent microspheres, Lumafluor, Durham, NC) or AAV viruses encoding channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV-ChR2-Venus) were performed as described (Anderson et al., 2010; Hooks et al., 2013). Retrograde tracer injections were made in either the contralateral M1 or ipsilateral M2, S1, and S2 of 6- to 7-week-old mice, to label corticocortical projection neurons in M1; brain slices were prepared 3-7 days later and imaged as described below. Viral injections were made in the motor thalamus of 3- to 4-week-old mice, targeting the ventrolateral nucleus, and optogenetic experiments in brain slices were performed ∼3 weeks later.
The motor cortex (M1) is classically considered an agranular area, lacking a distinct layer 4 (L4). Here, we tested the idea that M1, despite lacking a cytoarchitecturally visible L4, nevertheless possesses its equivalent in the form of excitatory neurons with input-output circuits like those of the L4 neurons in sensory areas. Consistent with this idea, we found that neurons located in a thin laminar zone at the L3/5A border in the forelimb area of mouse M1 have multiple L4-like synaptic connections: excitatory input from thalamus, largely unidirectional excitatory outputs to L2/3 pyramidal neurons, and relatively weak long-range corticocortical inputs and outputs. M1-L4 neurons were electrophysiologically diverse but morphologically uniform, with pyramidal-type dendritic arbors and locally ramifying axons, including branches extending into L2/3. Our findings therefore identify pyramidal neurons in M1 with the expected prototypical circuit properties of excitatory L4 neurons, and question the traditional assumption that motor cortex lacks this layer.
In 1909, a German scientist called Korbinian Brodmann published the first map of the outer layer of the human brain. After staining neurons with a dye and studying the structures of the cells and how they were organized, he realized that he could divide the cortex into 43 numbered regions.
