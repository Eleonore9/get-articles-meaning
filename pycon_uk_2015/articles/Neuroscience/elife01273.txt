 After losing a hand, simple tasks such as tying your shoelaces become a daily challenge, resulting in serious implications for quality of life and employment (Jang et al., 2011). How do different individuals adapt to such challenges, and what role does brain plasticity play in this adaptation? By addressing these questions in individuals with congenital or acquired hand absence we hope to shed light on the scope for adaptive plasticity in the adult human brain, thereby providing important information for informing future neurorehabilitation strategies. We assessed day-to-day limb-use strategies in individuals with acquired (n = 18, 10 below elbow) or congenital (n = 11, 10 below elbow) hand absence (see Table 1 for demographic details and prosthetic limb usage). Specifically, we quantified the extent to which individuals utilise their residual arms, relative to their intact hands (Figure 1A), in daily activities. We collected data from acceleration monitors, worn by a sub-set of 20 participants (8 congenital) while engaged in their normal routines. A laterality index, reflecting the relative number of movements performed by the intact hand vs the residual arm (Figure 1B), showed that both groups moved the intact hand more than the residual arm (t(7) = 3.48, p=0.01; t(11) = 10.60, p=0.001, one-sample t-test compared to zero for the congenital and acquired groups, respectively). This could be due both to greater use of the intact hand and also to the different position of the accelerometer on the two sides of the body (wrist vs arm), resulting in different acceleration profiles. Our main aim was to compare the degree of this laterality across the two 1-handed groups. We found that the acquired group exhibited stronger relative reliance on their intact hand, as demonstrated in a significantly greater lateralisation scores towards the intact hand, compared to the congenital group (t(18) = −2.67, p=0.016, Figure 1B).10.7554/eLife.01273.003Table 1.Demographic details of 1-handed individuals with acquired (A) and congenital (C) hand lossDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01273.003AgeDeprivation age (in years)Amp.

(B) Limb-use strategies, based on activity monitors for increased lateralised (intact hand) use. A laterality index, reflecting the relative number of movements performed by the intact hand vs the residual limb, was calculated using data from acceleration monitors (mean plus-minus s.e.m.), worn by 20 1-handed individuals (8 congenital) while engaged in their normal routines. Positive values represent a tendency to use the intact hand more than the residual limb. Although both groups exhibit such a tendency (t(7) = 3.48, p=0.01; t(11) = 10.60, p=0.001, one-sample t-test compared to zero for the congenital and acquired groups, respectively), the acquired group shows a significantly greater preference for the intact hand compared to the congenital group (t(18) = −2.67, p=0.016). (C) Questionnaire ratings (mean plus-minus s.e.m.) for residual arm usage in daily activities were significantly greater for the congenital group (t(1,27) = 3.65, p=0.001), suggesting they use their residual arm more frequently in daily activities, compared with the acquired group. (D) Questionnaire ratings for residual arm usage were negatively correlated with the laterality indices, measured based on acceleration monitoring (r(20) = −0.53, p=0.012), validating the questionnaires as a measurement of habitual usage strategies between the residual and intact limbs.

Using physiological measurements, we provide the first detailed description of patterns of daily limb usage in individuals with congenital and acquired limb-loss. Next, using fMRI we show that representation patterns in the deprived cortex of 1-handed individuals are contingent upon the limb-use strategy adopted by individuals, rather than a sensitive period in development: Individuals from either 1-handed group that rely more on their intact hands showed increased representation of the (ipsilateral) intact hand in the deprived cortex, irrespective of age at deprivation. These functional adaptations are further reflected in white matter structural integrity, as demonstrated using DTI. These findings shed new light on the extent of adult brain plasticity and have implications for rehabilitation. 18 individuals with sustained unilateral upper limb amputation (mean age plus-minus s.e.m = 46 plus-minus 3, 6 with absent right hand), 11 individuals with a congenital unilateral upper limb deficit (age = 35 plus-minus 4, 3 with absent right hand) and 22 intact controls (age = 41 plus-minus 3, 7 left hand dominant) were recruited for the study (see Table 1 for demographic details). Recruitment was carried through the Oxford Centre for Enablement and Opcare in accordance with NHS national research ethics service approval. Informed consent and consent to publish was obtained in accordance with ethical standards set out by the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and with procedures approved by the NHS (REC ref: 10/H0707/29). Data from one individual with acquired deprivation and one control were discarded, due to excessive head movements (>3 mm) during fMRI and problems during DTI data acquisition (respectively).
Arm-amputation involves two powerful drivers for brain plasticity—sensory deprivation and altered use. However, research has largely focused on sensory deprivation and maladaptive change. Here we show that adaptive patterns of limb usage after amputation drive cortical plasticity. We report that individuals with congenital or acquired limb-absence vary in whether they preferentially use their intact hand or residual arm in daily activities. Using fMRI, we show that the deprived sensorimotor cortex is employed by whichever limb individuals are over-using. Individuals from either group that rely more on their intact hands (and report less frequent residual arm usage) showed increased intact hand representation in the deprived cortex, and increased white matter fractional anisotropy underlying the deprived cortex, irrespective of the age at which deprivation occurred. Our results demonstrate how experience-driven plasticity in the human brain can transcend boundaries that have been thought to limit reorganisation after sensory deprivation in adults.
The loss of a limb will have a profound impact on an individual’s daily life. Nevertheless, individuals can employ a variety of behavioural strategies to adapt to the loss of, say, a hand. Some become skilled at using the residual part of their arm, while others prefer to rely on their other hand. Their brain, too, will undergo major changes. Many studies have shown that the region of the brain that controlled a given limb can be “taken over” by another part of the body if that limb is lost. This process has been previously considered to be harmful, as it has been linked to experiences of pain arising from the missing limb.
