 Neurons are highly polarized cells that usually elaborate two sets of morphologically and functionally distinct processes: a single long axon that sends out information to its targets, and multiple shorter dendrites that receive synaptic input from the environment or other neurons. Among the many differences between axons and dendrites, one distinct feature is that they have different microtubule (MT) organization. MTs, composed of strands of tubulin polymers, are dynamic structures with two molecularly and functionally distinct ends: a plus-end that favors polymerization and supports net growth and a minus-end that favors depolymerization (Howard and Hyman, 2003). Since MTs in neurites provide the platform for intracellular transport, and molecular motors such as kinesins and dyneins migrate toward either the plus- or minus-ends, MT polarity might play an important role in determining the directionality of transport events. One way to measure MT polarity in vivo is to perform time-lapse imaging studies using the EB family members of the TIPs (Tip Interacting Proteins), which bind transiently to the growing plus-ends of MTs (Baas and Lin, 2011). Based on the behavior of EB1 in neurites, it was cohesively concluded that MTs are uniformly polarized with their plus-ends oriented toward the distal tip in axons from worm to rodents. In the dendrites, MTs are mixed in the proximal region and uniformly plus-end-out in distal parts in cultured vertebrate neurons, whereas MTs exhibit a mixed orientation with minus-ends predominantly facing the distal dendrite in worm and fly (Baas et al., 1987; Baas et al., 1988; Stepanova et al., 2003; Rolls et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2008; Kollins et al., 2009; Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2011; Maniar et al., 2012). In order to understand the molecular mechanisms and physiological importance of differential neuronal MT organization, we studied MT organization in two bipolar neurons in C. elegans. The ventrally localized DA9 cell body elaborates two functionally distinct processes. An axon migrates to the dorsal nerve cord, where it extends anteriorly and forms presynaptic specializations, and a dendrite extends anteriorly along the ventral nerve cord (Figure 1A; White et al., 1976; Sym et al., 1999; Klassen and Shen, 2007). MT motors fused to a fluorescence tag have previously been used as indicators for MT polarity (Clark et al., 1997; Stone et al., 2008). To examine MT polarity in the DA9 neuron, we expressed fluorescent proteins fused with retrograde and anterograde motors, which should accumulate at the minus- and plus-ends of MTs, respectively. We found that YFP-tagged UNC-104/Kinesin3 exhibits dim diffuse fluorescence along the axon with dramatic accumulation at the distal tip, but is completely absent from the dendrite (Figure 1B). Conversely, DHC-1/dynein heavy chain fused with GFP shows weak staining along the dendrite with accumulation at the distal tip of the dendrite (Figure 1C). In addition, GFP fused to the slow Ncd family minus-end kinesin, KLP-16, exhibits a graded fluorescence signal from proximal to distal dendrite with accumulation at the distal tip of the dendrite (Figure 1D). The specific localization of the tagged KLP-16 motor is dependent on its motor activity, as motor-dead versions are largely diffuse through the DA9 processes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These localization data are consistent with previous observations made in mammalian and Drosophila neurons, which suggest that MTs are uniformly plus-end-out in the axon and predominantly minus-end-out in the dendrite.10.7554/eLife.00133.003Figure 1.UNC-116 (kinesin-1) is required for the minus-end-out MT polarity in the DA9 dendrite.(A) Schematic diagram of the morphology of the DA9 neuron.

Previous studies in neuronal cell cultures showed that intracellular transport of short MTs occurs robustly in neurites and can be driven by mitotic kinesins (Baas et al., 2006). While we did not find evidence that mitotic kinesins are required for DA9 MT organization, our data provide in vivo evidence that transport of MTs by another kinesin, kinesin-1, in the dendrite is critical for establishing or maintaining MT polarity. An interesting study in Drosophila sensory neurons showed that the minus-end motor dynein is required for the uniform plus-end-out MT organization in the axon but dispensable for dendritic MT organization (Zheng et al., 2008). A recent study in Drosophila neuron showed that another motor kinesin-2 complex is required to steer MTs growth in the dendrite branch point to maintain the uniform minus-end-out MT polarity in the dendrite (Mattie et al., 2010). Since kinesin-1 is highly conserved throughout evolution, we anticipate our findings to be a starting point for more sophisticated in vitro or in vivo analyses of MT polarity in neurons. If UNC-116/kinesin-1 slides plus-end-out MTs out of dendrites, one immediate question is how this process is restricted to dendrites. Maniar et al. (2012) recently showed that the MT-associated axon initial segment (AIS)-enriched protein UNC-33/CRMP is important for MT organization in both the axon and dendrite in worm sensory neurons. The AIS has been reported to play important roles in neuronal polarity (Hedstrom et al., 2008; Sobotzik et al., 2009). It is conceivable that AIS proteins provide critical regulatory roles for motor-based MT sliding by restricting the direction of MT transport. Interestingly, the AIS in vertebrate neurons is known to serve as a diffusion barrier for both transmembrane and cytosolic proteins. How it regulates MT transport will be an interesting question for future studies. Worms were raised on NGM plates at 20°C using OP50 Escherichia coli as a food source. N2 Bristol was utilized as the wild-type reference strain. The following mutant strains were obtained through the Caenorhabditics Genetics Center: FF41 unc-116(e2310) III, RB1975 klc-1(OK2609) IV, and CB1265 unc-104(e1265) II. TV6687 unc-116(rh24 sb79) III was a kind gift from Dr. McNally at University of California at Davis, TV3706 unc-116 (wy270) III, carrying a single L129 to F mutation in motor domain, (EL, unpublished data) was previously isolated from our laboratory.
In neurons, microtubules (MTs) span the length of both axons and dendrites, and the molecular motors use these intracellular ‘highways' to transport diverse cargo to the appropriate subcellular locations. Whereas axonal MTs are organized such that the plus-end is oriented out from the cell body, dendrites exhibit a mixed MTs polarity containing both minus-end-out and plus-end-out MTs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this differential organization, as well as its functional significance, are unknown. Here, we show that kinesin-1 is critical in establishing the characteristic minus-end-out MT organization of the dendrite in vivo. In unc-116 (kinesin-1/kinesin heavy chain) mutants, the dendritic MTs adopt an axonal-like plus-end-out organization. Kinesin-1 protein is able to cross-link anti-paralleled MTs in vitro. We propose that kinesin-1 regulates the dendrite MT polarity through directly gliding the plus-end-out MTs out of the dendrite using both the motor domain and the C-terminal MT-binding domain.
Neurons, or nerve cells, are excitable cells that transmit information using electrical and chemical signals. Nerve cells are generally composed of a cell body, multiple dendrites, and a single axon. The dendrites are responsible for receiving inputs and for transferring these signals to the cell body, whereas the axon carries signals away from the cell body and relays them to other cells.
