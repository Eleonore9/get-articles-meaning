 Dopamine (DA)-releasing neurons in the mammalian midbrain play an important role in fundamental behaviors, including motivation, reinforcement learning and motor control, and their dysfunction is associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders (Wise, 2004; Costa, 2007; Schultz, 2007; Morris et al., 2009; Redgrave et al., 2010). The major target of midbrain DA neurons is the striatum, a large subcortical structure implicated in the selection and reinforcement of motor actions. DA neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) project mainly to the dorsal striatum (also known as the caudate and putamen, CPu), whereas those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) innervate the ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens, NAc), forming the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, respectively. The striatum controls motor behavior through two parallel output streams with opposing effects; the so-called ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ pathways. Each pathway arises from distinct groups of GABAergic striatal projection neurons (SPNs) that differ, amongst other things, in their response to DA (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011; Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012). By providing DA to the striatum, SNc and VTA neurons are believed to play a pivotal role in balancing the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs. However, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms employed by DA neurons to modulate striatal function remains incomplete. We recently reported that activation of SNc axons in dorsal striatum evokes monosynaptic, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in SPNs (Tritsch et al., 2012; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). To determine whether this GABAergic signaling extends to DA neurons projecting to ventral striatum, we expressed channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) in the VTA using one of two approaches (‘Materials and methods’). We either injected Slc6a3-ires-Cre mice (Backman et al., 2006) stereotaxically with an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase-dependent ChR2 (Figure 1A) or drove ChR2 expression genetically by crossing Slc6a3-ires-Cre mice to transgenic mice (Madisen et al., 2012) containing a conditional allele of ChR2 in the Rosa26 locus (Figure 1D). Mice also harbored Drd2-Egfp or Drd1a-tdTomato bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenes to permit distinction between direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs, respectively (Gong et al., 2003; Ade et al., 2011). We performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from SPNs in sagittal brain slices of NAc in the presence of inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NBQX and R-CPP) and metabotropic GABAB receptors (CGP55845) to prevent excitatory synaptic transmission by dopaminergic axons, as well as modulatory effects of GABAB receptors, respectively. Under our recording conditions, optogenetic stimulation of VTA axons with brief (1 ms) flashes of blue light reliably evoked inward IPSCs in direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs that were blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonists picrotoxin (n = 12; Figure 1B,E) and SR95531 (n = 4, not shown). With the exception of synaptic latency, optogenetically-evoked IPSCs (oIPSCs) exhibited similar properties in both experimental systems and were consequently pooled for analysis. They averaged 353 ± 60 pA in peak amplitude (range = 68-905 pA; n = 16) and their kinetics were similar to those observed in dorsal striatum (Tritsch et al., 2012; Figure 1—figure supplement 1), with a 10-90% rise time of 2.4 ± 0.2 ms and a decay time constant of 46.8 ± 7.2 ms. The synaptic latency of oIPSCs in NAc did not differ from that observed in dorsal striatum under similar experimental conditions (Figure 1C,F), indicating that the connection is monosynaptic. Synaptic stimulation of midbrain DA neurons therefore directly engages GABAA receptors on SPNs in both dorsal and ventral striatum.10.7554/eLife.01936.003Figure 1.Stimulation of VTA axons evokes GABAergic currents in nucleus accumbens SPNs.ChR2 was expressed in VTA DA neurons virally (A-C) or genetically (D-F).

Note that the synaptic latency in these mice is significantly longer than in virally transduced Slc6a3-ires-Cre mice in both CPu and NAc (p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test), presumably because of lower ChR2 expression in Ai32 mice.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01936.00310.7554/eLife.01936.004Figure 1—figure supplement 1.Properties of DA neuron oIPSCs in dorsal striatum.ChR2 was expressed in SNc DA neurons virally.

The first trace obtained after break-in is in black and subsequent oIPSCs are shown in progressively lighter shades of gray. The magenta trace depicts the average waveform of the first five oIPSCs.

Amplitude is normalized to the first oIPSC after break-in. Note how the amplitude of oIPSCs progressively decreases with each stimulus under control conditions, regardless of the method used for expressing ChR2. This decrement in oIPSC amplitude is specific to dopaminergic synapses, as oIPSCs recorded from the collaterals of iSPNs in Adora2a-Cre expressing ChR2-mCherry in the dorsal striatum remained maintained their amplitude for the duration of the recording (n = 8; gray).

In this study, we combined histochemical and electrophysiological approaches to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern GABAergic signaling by DA neurons. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of midbrain DA neurons have the capacity to co-release GABA and identify presynaptic membrane GABA transporters as the likely mechanism employed by DA neurons to acquire GABA for vesicular exocytosis. All experimental manipulations were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Harvard Standing Committee on Animal Care following guidelines described in the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All mice were group-housed and maintained on a 12-hr light cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Slc6a3-ires-Cre knock-in mice expressing Cre recombinase in DA neurons (Backman et al., 2006) were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME; stock # 006660). These mice were crossed with Drd2-Egfp (GENSAT, founder line S118) or Drd1a-tdTomato (stock # 016204; Jackson Labs) BAC transgenic mice to permit distinction between direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs (Gong et al., 2003; Ade et al., 2011). To genetically target indirect pathway SPNs, Adora2a-Cre BAC transgenic mice (GENSAT, founder line KG139) were used. For stereotaxic viral injections, postnatal day 18-25 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in a small animal stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and injected with 1 μl of an adeno-associated virus (∼1012 genome copies per ml; UNC Vector Core Facility, Chapel Hill, NC) encoding Cre-dependent ChR2 (AAV2/8.EF1α.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry or AAV2/8.EF1α.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-EYFP), as described previously (Tritsch et al., 2012). Injection coordinates were 0.8 mm anterior from Lambda, 1.3 mm lateral and 4.4 mm below pia for SNc, and 0.8 mm anterior from Lambda, 0.6 mm lateral and 4.4 mm below pia for VTA. Alternatively, ChR2(H134R)-EYFP was expressed genetically in Cre-containing cells by crossing Slc6a3-ires-Cre;Drd2-Egfp or Slc6a3-ires-Cre;Drd1a-tdTomato mice with Ai32 mice (stock # 012569; Jackson Labs) (Madisen et al., 2012). The knock-in lines used in Figure 5 include Gad1-Egfp (Tamamaki et al., 2003) and Gad2-ires-Cre mice (Taniguchi et al., 2011). The latter were crossed with mice bearing a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter transgene (Ai14; stock # 007914; Jackson Labs) to reveal the distribution of Cre+ cells (Madisen et al., 2010). Mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Only mice heterozygous for all transgenes were used for experiments.
Synaptic transmission between midbrain dopamine neurons and target neurons in the striatum is essential for the selection and reinforcement of movements. Recent evidence indicates that nigrostriatal dopamine neurons inhibit striatal projection neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that activates GABAA receptors. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon extends to mesolimbic afferents, and confirm that the released neurotransmitter is GABA. However, the GABA synthetic enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 are not detected in midbrain dopamine neurons. Instead, these cells express the membrane GABA transporters mGAT1 (Slc6a1) and mGAT4 (Slc6a11) and inhibition of these transporters prevents GABA co-release. These findings therefore indicate that GABA co-release is a general feature of midbrain dopaminergic neurons that relies on GABA uptake from the extracellular milieu as opposed to de novo synthesis. This atypical mechanism may confer dopaminergic neurons the flexibility to differentially control GABAergic transmission in a target-dependent manner across their extensive axonal arbors.
The electrical signals that are fired along neurons cannot be transmitted across the small gaps, called synapses that are found between neurons. Instead, the neuron sending the signal releases chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse. These neurotransmitters bind to receptor proteins on the surface of the second neuron and control how it fires.
