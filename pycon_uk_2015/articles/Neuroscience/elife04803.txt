 Memory loss is the key symptom of dementia-related disorders along with impaired cognitive functioning such as language or reasoning. It is usually caused by Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementia. Its prevalence doubles from a low rate in 60-64 age group to 40-50% of those older than 85 (Lobo et al., 2000). Dementia is a progressive disease, which has a detrimental impact on the quality of life for patients. To date, pharmacological treatments for dementia have limited effects and there are no known treatments that cure or delay the progression of this memory impairment (Doody et al., 2014; Salloway et al., 2014). Therefore, a novel non-pharmacological approach such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently considered as an alternative treatment to reduce the symptomatic and progression of this memory deterioration (Hescham et al., 2013a). Progressive age-related memory decline has been previously described for human (Davis et al., 2003) and animal studies (Sloane et al., 1997; Ward et al., 1999; Kaczorowski and Disterhoft, 2009). We compared the short- and long-term memory functions in young (n = 20) and middle-aged (n = 15) rats using the NOR test (Figure 1A). Three-way ANOVA (group age × retention interval × object) with repeated-measures showed significant effects for object (F(1,82) = 18.043, p < 0.001), retention interval (F(2,82) = 13.956, p < 0.001), and the interaction group age × retention interval × object (F(1,82) = 4.160, p = 0.019) (Figure 1C,D). No differences were observed for group (F(1,82) = 0.009, p = n.s.). With regard to the duration of object exploration, there was no significant difference between the young and middle-aged rats in the acquisition phase (t(28) = −0.742, p = n.s.), see Supplementary file 1A. However, a decrease in the duration of novel object exploration was observed for the middle-aged group when compared to the young in the long-term (t(26) = 4.129, p < 0.001), but not the short-term (t(29) = 0.014, p = n.s.) memory. Interestingly, the young animals spent relatively more time with the novel object as compared to the familiar object in both the short- (t(18) = −5.23, p < 0.001) and long-term (t(14) = −8.722, p < 0.001) phase (Figure 1C,D). In the middle-aged rats, no significant effect was found for discrimination between the novel and familiar objects in the short- and long-term memory retention interval (all t(11) > −2.058, p = n.s.), indicating a possible manifestation of memory deficit in the middle-aged animals.10.7554/eLife.04803.003Figure 1.Experimental protocol of the novel-object recognition test (A), and representative illustration of the stimulating electrode localization in the vmPFC (B).The box plots show the comparisons between young (4 month old) and middle-aged (12 month old) animals on the short- and long-term memory retention interval in the novel-object recognition task (C, D). Note: there was a decrease of time spent in the novel object exploration in the middle-aged animals as compared to the young rats, suggesting a possible manifestation of memory deficit in this animal model. Indication: *, significant difference from the middle-aged rats; #, significant difference from the familiar object of respective age animals, (p < 0.05).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04803.003 The present findings confirm the results of previous studies of progressive age-related memory impairment in the middle-aged rats (Rex et al., 2005; Kaczorowski and Disterhoft, 2009). We next conducted electrical stimulation in this animal model of memory deficit, using HFS and LFS with various stimulation current intensities in the NOR test. Our results showed that HFS at 200 μA and LFS at 50, 200, and 400 μA significantly enhanced the memory functions in the short-, but not the long-term memory retention interval when compared to the sham. We next carried out chronic stimulation in this middle-aged rat model. We hypothesized that chronic stimulation would increase both the short- and long-term memory functions via a mechanism of enhanced hippocampal neuroplasticity. Previous studies have shown that memory deficits were partly due to the disruption of the hippocampal neuroplasticity (Deupree et al., 1993; Rex et al., 2005). Therefore, our hypothesis was driven by findings that DBS in various brain targets increased BDNF level (Hamani et al., 2012; Ying et al., 2012) and enhanced neurogenesis-related functions (Toda et al., 2008; Kadar et al., 2011; Stone et al., 2011) in the hippocampus. Further, this hypothesis was also supported by the fact that the increased BDNF level and neurogenesis function in the hippocampus were strongly correlated with the hippocampal-dependent memory tests (Drapeau et al., 2003; Erickson et al., 2011). Thus, after chronic stimulation, we found significant improvement in both the short- and long-term memories in the NOR test, as well as the spatial memory performances during the MWM task as compared to the sham. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (12 month old, n = 144; and 4 month-old, n = 20; National University of Singapore, Singapore) were individually housed with ad libitum access to food and water. The animal colony was maintained under controlled temperature (about 24-26°C), humidity (60-70%), and 12 hr dark/light cycle (lights-off at 0700). All procedures were approved by the Institutional of Animals Care and Use Committee of Nanyang Technological University.
Memory dysfunction is a key symptom of age-related dementia. Although recent studies have suggested positive effects of electrical stimulation for memory enhancement, its potential targets remain largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that spatially targeted deep brain stimulation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex enhanced memory functions in a middle-aged rat model. Our results show that acute stimulation enhanced the short-, but not the long-term memory in the novel-object recognition task. Interestingly, after chronic high-frequency stimulation, both the short- and long-term memories were robustly improved in the novel-object recognition test and Morris water-maze spatial task compared to sham. Our results also demonstrated that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation upregulated neurogenesis-associated genes along with enhanced hippocampal cell proliferation. Importantly, these memory behaviors were strongly correlated with the hippocampal neurogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex high-frequency stimulation may serve as a novel effective therapeutic target for dementia-related disorders.
Memory loss in older people is a serious and widespread problem that affects up to 50% of those over the age of 85. It is a key symptom of dementia, but despite the growing impact of this disease on society, there are no treatments currently available that can effectively stop or delay the progression of the symptoms.
