 Defecation is important for food processing that provides nourishment to the animal. It eliminates waste (feces) from the digestive tract via the anus (Thomas, 1990; Heaton et al., 1992; Lembo and Camilleri, 2003), an unglamorous but essential body function. Compared to the extensively studied feeding behavior, defecation has received relatively little attention. Malfunction of defecation can lead to constipation and other diseases (Lembo and Camilleri, 2003), and abnormal development of neural circuits governing defecation may underlie birth defects such as Hirschsprung's disease due to elimination of intestinal ganglion cells required for bowel peristalsis (Romeo et al., 1994; Passarge, 2002), one of the major birth defects of the digestive system afflicting one in 4000 of the population. The Drosophila larval hindgut is the last part of the intestine, posterior to the Malpighian tubule, on the dorsal side under larval cuticle. At the posterior end of the hindgut is anal sphincter, which has a layer of thick sphincter muscles and a much narrower canal (Figure 1A, Figure1—figure supplement 1) (Murakami and Shiotsuki, 2001). Because the Drosophila larval body wall is transparent, contractions of the hindgut and anal sphincter can be monitored in vivo. Fluorescent markers, expressed with a hindgut-specific byn-Gal4 (Johansen et al., 2003), allowed visualization of contractions of the larval hindgut and anus sphincter in whole-mount of living larvae (Figure 1B). The defecation behavior consists of sequential contractions of the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter in a very stereotypical manner (Figure 1B,D), leading to opening of the anal slit to expel feces out of the lumen. This defecation process is repeated every 38 s at 25°C (Figure 1D). To demonstrate those gut movements triggered defecation, we fed the larvae with yeast laced with blue food dye and video taped their defecation cycle. As shown in Figure 1C and Video 1, each sequential contraction of hindgut and anus sphincter triggered a defecation cycle to expel feces out of the body.10.7554/eLife.03293.003Figure 1.The periodical defecation process of the Drosophila larvae and the innervation of hindgut and anal sphincter by motor neurons.(A and B) Sequential contractions of the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter.

The animal was fed with dyed food and its feces can be seen when moving along the intestine.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03293.006 This study establishes the Drosophila larva as a model system for studying the defecation behavior. We found that Drosophila larvae exhibit periodic defecation cycles, involving sequential contractions of the hindgut and the anal sphincter. We also found two groups of neurons, which innervate the hindgut and anal sphincter respectively, and can excite the hindgut and anal sphincter muscle in a sequential manner. In addition, we found a single sensory neuron that could sense the opening of the anal slit and send feedback to the motor neurons (Figure 7). Studies of C. elegans as a model system have investigated the defecation circuit (Thomas, 1990; Avery and Thomas, 1997; Branicky and Hekimi, 2006; Kwan et al., 2008). Studies of the adult fly have identified neurons regulating defecation behaviors subject to dietary and reproductive modulation (Cognigni et al., 2011). In this study of the defecation behavior in Drosophila larvae, we have identified not only the motor neurons innervating gut muscles but also a sensory neuron strategically located to sense radial stretch during defecation and provide feedback to the central nervous system.10.7554/eLife.03293.027Figure 7.Graphic summary of the motor neurons and a mechanosensitive sensory neuron in the defecation circuitry.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03293.027 All the larvae were raised in the normal fly medium (for the light activation assay, 100 µM all-trans retinal was added to the food).

Defecation allows the body to eliminate waste, an essential step in food processing for animal survival. In contrast to the extensive studies of feeding, its obligate counterpart, defecation, has received much less attention until recently. In this study, we report our characterizations of the defecation behavior of Drosophila larvae and its neural basis. Drosophila larvae display defecation cycles of stereotypic frequency, involving sequential contraction of hindgut and anal sphincter. The defecation behavior requires two groups of motor neurons that innervate hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively, and can excite gut muscles directly. These two groups of motor neurons fire sequentially with the same periodicity as the defecation behavior, as revealed by in vivo Ca2+ imaging. Moreover, we identified a single mechanosensitive sensory neuron that innervates the anal slit and senses the opening of the intestine terminus. This anus sensory neuron relies on the TRP channel NOMPC but not on INACTIVE, NANCHUNG, or PIEZO for mechanotransduction.
In animals, the final stage in the digestion of food is the removal of waste from the body. Until recently, however, defecation has received less attention than other aspects of digestion such as feeding behavior and nutrition.
