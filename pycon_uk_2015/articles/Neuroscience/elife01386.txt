 In darkness, sparse single photon signals are relayed to retinal ganglion cells via a high gain/high convergence pathway formed by rods, rod bipolar cells, amacrine AII cells, and cone bipolar cells (Nelson, 1982; Dunn et al., 2006). However, rod signals can bypass rod bipolar cells and enter directly into the cone pathway (DeVries and Baylor, 1995). The earliest opportunity for this crossover is represented by rod-cone gap junctions (GJs) (Raviola and Gilula, 1973; Tsukamoto et al., 2001). GJs are assemblies of channels made by the docking of pairs of connexon hemichannels on adjacent cells, each formed by six connexin subunits. Cones contact nearby photoreceptors mainly at the tips of thin telodendria, which emerge from their synaptic pedicles, where they express connexin isoform 36 (Cx36) (Lee et al., 2003; O’Brien et al., 2012), while the isoform expressed by rods has not been conclusively identified (Lee et al., 2003; Feigenspan et al., 2004). The rod-cone junctional plaques are very small, each containing few connexon channels (Raviola and Gilula, 1973), and although rod signals were recorded in cat (Nelson, 1977) and in macaque cones (Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995, 1999; Hornstein et al., 2005), the extent to which rod-cone coupling contributes to mammalian vision remains unclear. On the one hand, psychophysical and electroretinographic (ERG) experiments, in humans, detected putative correlates of rod-cone coupling (reviewed by Sharpe and Stockman, 1999), and ganglion cell and ERG recordings, in mice lacking Cx36, supported the view that rod-cone coupling is relevant for dim light vision (Deans et al., 2002; Volgyi et al., 2004; Abd-El-Barr et al., 2009; Seeliger et al., 2011); on the other hand, alternative mechanisms could explain the human data (Sharpe and Stockman, 1999), and recordings in cone bipolar cells in Cx36 knockout mice suggested that rod-cone coupling plays a marginal role in rod signal flow (Pang et al., 2010, 2012). Cangiano et al. (2012) showed that mouse cones can be recorded with perforated patch clamp much more frequently than their numeric proportion of ∼3% of photoreceptors (Jeon et al., 1998). We exploited this ability to dissect rod input in cones using two light stimulation protocols, a kinetics protocol and a spectral protocol, described in the ‘Materials and methods’ and Figure 1. We present data from 74 cones.10.7554/eLife.01386.003Figure 1.The different flash sensitivities, kinetics, and spectral preferences of rods and cones are exploited to dissect their electrical coupling.(A upper graph) Comparison of rod and cone responses to green flashes. Continuous lines on the right are simulated flash response profiles of mixed S/M cones at four retinal latitudes (1-4, from dorsalmost to ventralmost; inset in lower graph) and pure S cones, based on recently published models (Daniele et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; see ‘Materials and methods’). Thick line and shaded area on the left show the mean ± 1 SD of rod flash response profiles from patch and loose seal recordings in this study (n = 16; 24°C; average of Michaelis-Menten fits in individual rods). Dashed lines in the middle reproduce flash response profiles from spectrally unidentified mouse cones recently recorded with patch (reproduced from Figure 3; Cangiano et al., 2012, 24°C): the high sensitivity of cone photovoltages is suggestive of rod input. (A lower graph) Width at 50% amplitude (mean and SD) of rod flash responses, obtained here with loose seal recordings to avoid kinetics rundown (n = 4, 24°C). (B) Comparison of rod and cone responses to ultraviolet flashes. Rod response profiles in the ultraviolet were obtained by rightward shift of those in the green (panel A) by a factor of 2.2 (arrow; our estimate from two rods in which full flash response profiles were delivered at both wavelengths). Graphs in panels A and B were used to select dim and bright flashes for the protocols used in our experiments (C and D), aimed at dissecting rod input in cones: dim flashes (16.6 photons·µm−2) elicited large responses in rods while being too weak to stimulate cones, while bright flashes (a: 1570, b: 3140 ph·µm−2) were sufficient to saturate rods for >1 s and evoke moderate responses in cones. (C) Kinetics protocol made of sequences of three 520 nm (green, G) flashes, each consisting of dim/brighta/dim flashes, with the third flash occurring at increasing delays. Expected responses in a rod, an uncoupled cone, and a coupled cone. (D) Spectral protocol made of sequences of 4 dim and brightb flashes at 520 nm (G) and 365 nm (UV). Expected responses in an uncoupled and coupled S/M-cone (UV-opsin-dominated cone). When coupled, the cone should prefer dim G to dim UV flashes, while the opposite should occur with bright flashes. The cone’s intrinsic spectral phenotype is unmasked with a rod-saturating pre-flash.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01386.003 Patch clamp recordings in the mouse retina, a key model in current vision research, were combined with light stimulation, current injection, and pharmacology, to show that rod-cone coupling may have a remarkable impact on cone function. The possibility that what we interpret as rod input could instead represent a change in cone phototransduction can be rejected, as it is contradicted by our findings that: (i) the GJ blocker MFA abolished rod-like responses in cones, (ii) dim and bright flash responses have different reversal potentials, (iii) in many cones, dim and bright flash responses (delivered after a rod-saturating pre-flash) display opposite spectral preferences. Moreover, in preliminary recordings from the cones of mice lacking Cx36, we did not observe rod-like features (Asteriti et al., 2013). Except when stated otherwise, dissection and recordings were performed as previously described (Cangiano et al., 2007, 2012). Briefly, adult C57BL/6J mice, raised on a 12/12 hr light cycle, were dark-adapted for 3-5 hr and recorded during the subjective late afternoon of the animal. Dissection and slicing were done in chilled bicarbonate-buffered Ames’ medium (A1420; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) under dim far red illumination. Blind patch recordings of photoreceptors (at 24°C or 36°C) were also done in Ames’ medium and targeted sections of retinal slices (250 µm) corresponding to both the central and peripheral retina. We could not identify the position of our recordings along the dorsoventral axis of the retina. Perforated patch clamp and whole cell recordings were obtained from both rods and cones, while loose seal recordings could be obtained only from rods. Several intracellular solutions were used in this study, all including 0.5 mg·ml−1 Lucifer Yellow and corrected to a pH of 7.20 with KOH/HCl. For perforated patch, the backfilling solution also contained 0.4 mg·ml−1 Amphotericin-B pre-dissolved in DMSO at 60 mg·ml−1. Standard perforated patch: (in mM) 90 Kaspartate, 20 K2SO4, 15 KCl, 10 NaCl, 5 K2Pipes. EGTA zero Ca2+ perforated patch: 80 Kaspartate, 20 K2SO4, 25 KCl, 10 NaCl, 5 K2Pipes, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl2. EGTA low Ca2+ whole cell: 90 Kaspartate, 20 K2SO4, 10 KCl, 5 NaCl, 5 K2Pipes, 4 Na2ATP, 0.1 NaGTP, 5 EGTA, 4.2 MgCl2, 1.1 CaCl2. BAPTA low Ca2+ whole cell: 74.5 Kaspartate, 20 K2SO4, 10 KCl, 5 NaCl, 5 K2Pipes, 4 Na2ATP, 0.1 NaGTP, 7 K4BAPTA, 4.2 MgCl2, 1.15 CaCl2. EGTA high Ca2+ whole cell: 90 Kaspartate, 20 K2SO4, 10 KCl, 5 NaCl, 5 K2Pipes, 4 Na2ATP, 0.1 NaGTP, 5 EGTA, 4.2 MgCl2, 4.8 CaCl2. The low and high calcium whole cell solutions were estimated to provide free Ca2+ concentrations of 50 nM and (approximately) 5 µM, respectively, and a free Mg2+ concentration of ∼0.7 mM (Maxchelator software; Ca-Mg-ATP-EGTA Calculator v1.0 and WebMaxC standard). Based on an analysis of the liquid junction and Donnan potentials in our perforated-patch recordings (Cangiano et al., 2012), we report uncorrected values of the membrane potential. In some experiments, GJs were blocked with meclofenamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich).
Rod and cone photoreceptors are coupled by gap junctions (GJs), relatively large channels able to mediate both electrical and molecular communication. Despite their critical location in our visual system and evidence that they are dynamically gated for dark/light adaptation, the full impact that rod-cone GJs can have on cone function is not known. We recorded the photovoltage of mouse cones and found that the initial level of rod input increased spontaneously after obtaining intracellular access. This process allowed us to explore the underlying coupling capacity to rods, revealing that fully coupled cones acquire a striking rod-like phenotype. Calcium, a candidate mediator of the coupling process, does not appear to be involved on the cone side of the junctional channels. Our findings show that the anatomical substrate is adequate for rod-cone coupling to play an important role in vision and, possibly, in biochemical signaling among photoreceptors.
People can see in a range of light levels—from dim moonlight to bright midday sun—because our eyes contain two types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones. Rods are more plentiful than cones, and while they are sensitive at low light levels, rods can only provide grey-scale vision. Further, bright light can rapidly ‘dazzle’ the ability of rods to see in near-darkness, and they are slow to recover when this happens. In contrast, cones need bright light to function, but allow us to see in colour.
