 Disulfide bonds have a critical role in stabilizing correctly folded secreted and membrane proteins (Fass, 2012). Dedicated enzymatic machinery, consisting of disulfide exchange catalysts of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) class, rapidly introduces disulfide bonds into nascent polypeptide chains. The recycling of PDIs back to their oxidized form is mediated by upstream oxidases, exemplified by ERO1 and back-up enzymes, such as PRDX4 and VKOR that exploit O2, H2O2, and vitamin K epoxide, respectively, as downstream electron acceptors. Defects in components of this electron transfer chain markedly affect protein folding homeostasis in the ER (Sevier and Kaiser, 2008; Rutkevich and Williams, 2012; Zito, 2013). Kumar et al. recently reported that the mammalian pro-apoptotic gene ChaC1 encodes a glutathione-specific γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase that efficiently degrades glutathione (Kumar et al., 2012). We confirmed their observations by measuring the ability of purified murine ChaC1 (expressed in E. coli) to degrade glutathione in vitro: At submicromolar enzyme concentrations, recombinant ChaC1 was able to degrade a 10 mM solution of reduced glutathione within 1 hr (Figure 1A). The enzymatic activity was selective towards reduced glutathione (GSH) (Figure 1B). The inability of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to serve as a substrate for degradation correlated with its inability to bind a Chac1-based optical probe whose fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal reflects substrate binding (Figure 1C-D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). An E116Q mutation abolished all enzymatic activity (Figure 1E), as observed previously (Kumar et al., 2012).10.7554/eLife.03421.003Figure 1.ChaC1 efficiently and selectively degrades reduced glutathione.(A) A bar-graph representation of residual glutathione levels following incubation of 10 mM glutathione with the indicated concentrations of bacterially expressed mouse ChaC1. Varying concentrations of enzymes were assayed at a single time point (left panel) and varying initial concentrations of glutathione were assayed at different time points (right panel). (B) Comparison of the ability of ChaC1 to eliminate reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Note that ChaC1 effectively eliminated reduced glutathione, but had no effect on oxidized glutathione. (C) Cartoon of the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe, OG-ChaC1-Cherry, used to detect substrate binding to ChaC1. Shown is a model of murine ChaC1 (UniProt Q8R3J5) residues 31-204, created by Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg, 2009) based on the crystal structure of γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase (PDB 2RBH). The side chain of Cys 92, which has been modified with the Oregon Green (OG) donor, is highlighted, as is the C-terminus of the protein, site of the fused mCherry fluorescent acceptor. (D) Time-resolved FRET signal (expressed as the ratio of the emission signal at 532 nm and 670 nm upon excitation at 480 nm) of the OG-ChaC1-Cherry probe [2.5 µM] following exposure to 10 mM reduced (GSH) or oxidized glutathione(GSSG). Where indicated, the sample was injected with dithiotreitol (DTT) to reduce the GSSG and convert it to a substrate for ChaC1. The biphasic change in FRET signal upon exposure to GSH is consistent with binding followed by breakdown of GSH by the probe, which retains its enzymatic activity.

Nearly complete depletion of ER glutathione had no measurable effect on the rate of disulfide bond formation in the highly sensitized experimental setting of cells deficient in ER thiol oxidases. More surprising was the lack of any measurable effect of glutathione depletion on processes that require a pool of reduced PDI enzymes: the disulfide shuffling-dependent maturation of nascent LDL-R and the degradation of a folding incompetent mutant NHK-A1AT. Furthermore, depletion of ER glutathione was without effect on two sensitive, broad-spectrum UPR reporters, arguing that glutathione is indeed dispensable to a broad range of processes required for protein folding homeostasis in the ER of cultured mammalian cells.

Protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires efficient protein thiol oxidation, but also relies on a parallel reductive process to edit disulfides during the maturation or degradation of secreted proteins. To critically examine the widely held assumption that reduced ER glutathione fuels disulfide reduction, we expressed a modified form of a cytosolic glutathione-degrading enzyme, ChaC1, in the ER lumen. ChaC1CtoS purged the ER of glutathione eliciting the expected kinetic defect in oxidation of an ER-localized glutathione-coupled Grx1-roGFP2 optical probe, but had no effect on the disulfide editing-dependent maturation of the LDL receptor or the reduction-dependent degradation of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin. Furthermore, glutathione depletion had no measurable effect on induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR); a sensitive measure of ER protein folding homeostasis. These findings challenge the importance of reduced ER glutathione and suggest the existence of alternative electron donor(s) that maintain the reductive capacity of the ER.
Proteins are basically strings of amino acids that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape, and this shape is often important for the protein's function. Some proteins have bonds between pairs of cysteines—an amino acid that contains sulfur—in different parts of the protein to maintain its correct shape.
