 Cilia and flagella (interchangeable terms) are microtubule-based organelles surrounded by a specialized plasma membrane. These organelles are found protruding at the surface of a wide range of eukaryotic cells where they exert several roles including cellular motility, sensory reception and developmental signaling (Fliegauf et al., 2007; Drummond, 2012). Although cilia and flagella can differ by their functions, they share the same basic structure and are mainly assembled by an evolutionary conserved process called intraflagellar transport (IFT) (Kozminski et al., 1993; Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002). During IFT, large protein complexes called IFT trains are moved from the base to the tip of the flagellum by kinesin-2 (anterograde IFT) (Kozminski et al., 1995) and back towards the base by cytoplasmic dynein-1b/2 (retrograde IFT) (Pazour et al., 1998). The IFT particles are composed of at least 20 different proteins (Cole et al., 1998; Follit et al., 2009; Taschner et al., 2011) and can be divided in two different complexes known as complex A (made of at least 6 proteins) and B (made of at least 14 proteins) that are needed for retrograde and anterograde IFT respectively. Inactivation of IFT-B proteins or of the kinesin motor results in the failure to construct the flagellum whereas IFT-A proteins and the IFT dynein contribute to retrograde transport. Nevertheless, little is known about how the two processes are interconnected, as the interaction between the IFT complexes and their molecular motors is still poorly understood. The T. brucei IFT27 gene (TritrypDB Accession number Tb927.3.5550) has a 552 nucleotide-long sequence that encodes a predicted protein of 183 amino acids (predicted molecular weight of 20.64 kDa). BLAST analyses show that IFT27 shares significant homology (E value = 2e−27) with the Rab-like 4 (RABL4) GTPase found in Homo sapiens and vertebrates. IFT27 homologues are present in the genomes of all ciliated organisms except in Drosophila, C. elegans, Giardia, and some ferns and mosses (van Dam et al., 2013). The predicted trypanosome protein contains all five consensus domains needed for GTP/GDP binding and GTPase activity found in most Rab proteins (Figure 1), indicating that IFT27 could be a functional small G protein. Additionally, all IFT27 sequences lack the prenylation motif (two cysteins at the C terminal end) found in Rab proteins suggesting that the protein is not lipid modified and thus unlikely to interact with the cellular membrane.10.7554/eLife.02419.003Figure 1.Sequence alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of IFT27 homologues and modified IFT27 sequences.Alignment was generated using CLC main workbench; the most conserved residues are shown in black, the less conserved in yellow.

Amongst the possible regulators, several small GTPases have been associated with the flagellum: ARL-13b is involved in the stabilization of ciliary assembly in C. elegans and its mutations are associated with a ciliopathy named Joubert syndrome (Cantagrel et al., 2008; Cevik et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010). The RAN importin system, known to be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, is responsible for the entry of the kinesin KIF17 inside the primary cilium (Dishinger et al., 2010). However, none of these proteins are part of any of the IFT complexes. All procyclic T. brucei cell lines were derivatives of the strain 427 and grown in SDM79 medium with hemin and 10% fetal calf serum. The 29-13 cell line expressing the T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline-repressor (Wirtz et al., 1999) has been described previously, as well as the cell line expressing GFP::IFT52 (Absalon et al., 2008b). For generation of the IFT27RNAi cell line, a 360-nucleotide fragment of IFT27 (Tb 927.3.5550) was amplified by PCR and cloned in the pZJM vector (Wang et al., 2000), allowing tetracycline-inducible expression of dsRNA generating RNAi upon transfection in the 29-13 recipient cell line. The dsRNA is expressed from two tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters facing each other in the pZJM vector. Primers were selected using the RNAit algorithm to ensure that the fragment lacked significant identity to other genes to avoid cross-RNAi (Redmond et al., 2003). The fragment was amplified by PCR with the forward primer cgatcgAAGCTTaaacttgcgtcttcaggtgg and the reverse primer gtcatCTCGAGatttgcgagatctttcccct, digested with XhoI and HindIII (sites underlined) and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pZJM vector. The plasmid was linearized at the unique NotI site in the rDNA intergenic targeting region before transfection (Wang et al., 2000). GeneCust Europe (Dudelange, Luxembourg) conducted the chemical synthesis of the pPCPFReGFPIFT27 plasmid allowing a GFP tagging at the N-terminal of IFT27. The whole IFT27 gene (552 nucleotides) was synthetized, digested with NheI and EcoRV and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pPCPFR vector (Adhiambo et al., 2009). The resulting plasmid was linearized with NsiI, targeting integration in the intergenic region of PFR2. Generation of the p2845TdTomatoIFT140 plasmid enabling the expression of TdTomato::IFT140 was performed by modifying the p2845IFT140 mCherry plasmid. The mCherry gene was removed from p2845IFT140 using XhoI and HindIII while simultaneasouly getting the TdTomato gene from the p2675TdTomatoIFT81 plasmid with the same restriction enzymes. Ligation was performed between the digested p2845IFT140 plasmid and the TdTomato insert overnight at 16°C, the resulting plasmid was then transfected into XL-10 Gold Ultracomptent Cells (Agilent Technologies, France) to allow amplification. Plasmids from 10 different colonies were double digested with XhoI and HindIII to assess the presence of the TdTomato insert.
The construction of cilia and flagella depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional movement of two protein complexes (IFT-A and IFT-B) driven by specific kinesin and dynein motors. IFT-B and kinesin are associated to anterograde transport whereas IFT-A and dynein participate to retrograde transport. Surprisingly, the small GTPase IFT27, a member of the IFT-B complex, turns out to be essential for retrograde cargo transport in Trypanosoma brucei. We reveal that this is due to failure to import both the IFT-A complex and the IFT dynein into the flagellar compartment. To get further molecular insight about the role of IFT27, GDP- or GTP-locked versions were expressed in presence or absence of endogenous IFT27. The GDP-locked version is unable to enter the flagellum and to interact with other IFT-B proteins and its sole expression prevents flagellum formation. These findings demonstrate that a GTPase-competent IFT27 is required for association to the IFT complex and that IFT27 plays a role in the cargo loading of the retrograde transport machinery.
Long, thin structures called cilia and flagella are found on the surface of many cells, and perform a range of roles, including propelling the cells around or sensing changes in the surrounding environment. A process called intraflagellar transport (IFT for short) is responsible for flagellum construction in eukaryotic cells. Protein complexes called IFT trains carry the building blocks that make up flagella along microtubule ‘tracks’ between the base and the tip of a flagellum.
