 Cavin-3 (PRKCDBP, hSRBC) is a tumor suppressor protein of unclear function. In humans, cavin-3 is encoded in the 11p15.5 tumor suppressor locus and loss of cavin-3 expression is common in many epithelial and glial derived cancers (Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008; Martinez et al., 2009; Tong et al., 2010; Caren et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011). Cavin-3 expression is also absent in many cancer cell lines and ectopic expression of cavin-3 in these cells is sufficient to suppress their tumorigenesis in athymic mice (Xu et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2011). How cavin-3 expression suppresses tumorigenesis is not clear; however, forced over-expression of cavin-3 can induce G1 arrest and promote apoptosis (Lee et al., 2011), suggesting that cavin-3 may suppress mitogenic signaling. We employed two model systems to investigate whether loss of cavin-3 influences cell signaling. The first model system examined acute effects by depleting cavin-3 with siRNA in human SV589 fibroblasts over a time course of 15 days (Figures 1-3). The second model system examined chronic effects by knocking out the cavin-3 locus in the mouse and characterizing the consequences of loss of cavin-3 in embryonic fibroblasts (Figure 4). Because loss of cavin-3 is associated with cancer in multiple tissues and cancer is associated with elevated mitogenic signaling, we hypothesized that loss of cavin-3 might augment signaling in response to growth factors.10.7554/eLife.00905.003Figure 1.Knockdown of cavin-3 suppresses mitogen-dependent ERK activation.(A) Loss of cavin-3 suppresses IE response. Human SV589 fibroblasts were mock treated (0 day) or treated with cavin-3 siRNA for 2, 7 or 14 days. Knockdown was maintained by splitting and re-transfecting cells with cavin-3 siRNA on days 5, 9, and 12. Cells were then serum starved for 20 hr and RNA from cells was either harvested immediately or following treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF for 1 or 3 hr. Bars indicate the number of transcripts whose mean expression increased or decreased twofold following 1 hr, but not 3 hr, treatment. Solid and open bars indicate the number of transcripts common to transcripts induced or suppressed in the absence of knockdown. Hashed bars indicate knockdown-specific transcripts. Microarrays were performed in triplicate for 47,323 transcripts. Complete microarray data is provided (Dryad: Michaely et al., 2013). (B) Leading edge analysis shows that loss of cavin-3 impairs ERK activation by EGF. Transcripts induced by 1 hr but not 3 hr of EGF stimulation were ordered based upon fold-induction using microarray data collected from cells without knockdown (No KD). Fold-inductions for the top 15 transcripts are shown together with fold-inductions for the same transcripts in the 3-day, 8-day and 15-day knockdowns. All data are means ± SD, n = 3. (*) indicates genes for which published data has identified transcriptional regulation by ERK (Agarwal et al., 1995; Gille et al., 1995; Cohen, 1996; Ochsner et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2004; Hosokawa et al., 2005; Stockhausen et al., 2005; Bradley et al., 2008). (C) Cavin-3 knockdown impairs ERK translocation to the nucleus. Fibroblasts were mock treated (No KD) or treated with cavin-3 siRNA for 2 days, starved of serum for 20 hr, stimulated with EGF for 15 min, fixed and immunostained for total ERK. Nuclei were stained using DAPI. (D) Knockdown impairs cFos induction. Fibroblasts were mock treated (No KD) or treated with cavin-3 siRNA for 2 days, starved 20 hr for serum and stimulated with EGF for the indicated time. Cells were then lysed and immunoblotted for the indicated protein. (E) Loss of cavin-3 suppresses ERK activation by diverse mitogens. Fibroblasts were mock treated (No KD) or treated with cavin-3 siRNA, cultured for 2 days in serum, serum starved overnight and stimulated with the indicated mitogen. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for indicated proteins.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.00310.7554/eLife.00905.004Figure 2.Knockdown of cavin-3 activates Akt.(A) Loss of cavin-3 first slows then accelerates cell proliferation. Fibroblasts were mock treated or treated with siRNA against cavin-3 and counted daily. Cells were re-treated and re-plated on day 5. On day 9, cells that had been treated with cavin-3 siRNA were either re-treated or allowed to recover from cavin-3 depletion (Release). Doubling times (td) are indicated. (B) Protein profile of cavin-3 knockdown cells over time. SV589 fibroblasts were mock treated (No KD) or treated with cavin-3 siRNA. Cells were split and re-treated with siRNA on days 5, 9, and 12. Cell lysates were prepared when indicated and immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. (C) Knockdown augments pAkt at the expense of pERK. pERK, ERK, pAkt, Akt and cavin-3 immunoblot staining was quantified by densitometry. Data were normalized to No KD (0 day) and are means ± SEM, n = 3. *p<0.05 as compared to No KD. (D) Knockdown confers resistance to PD98059 and sensitivity to LY294002. PD98059 interrupts the signaling pathway from growth factor receptors (GFRs) to ERK by inhibiting MEK. LY294002 interrupts the signaling pathway from GFRs to Akt by inhibiting the p110 subunit of PI3K. Cells were depleted of cavin-3 for the indicated number of days and treated with the indicated concentrations of PD98059 or LY294002 for 24 hr. Data are shown as a percentage of untreated and are means ± SEM, n = 6. (E) Knockdown suppresses TNFα-dependent apoptosis. The indicated cells were treated overnight with 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide alone (−) or in combination with 10 ng/ml TNFα (+) and assayed for apoptotic cells by TUNEL staining (top) and PARP1 cleavage (arrow, bottom). TUNEL data are means ± SEM, from three independent experiments. *p<0.05 as compared to no TNFα.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.00410.7554/eLife.00905.005Figure 3.Knockdown of cavin-3 increases transcription of biosynthetic genes and induces aerobic glycolysis.(A) Knockdown of cavin-3 progressively alters gene expression. RNA from SV589 fibroblasts grown in normal medium was harvested from mock-transfected cells or cells treated with cavin-3 siRNA for 3, 8, or 15 days. Transcripts that were increased or decreased twofold in triplicate microarrays are presented as Venn diagrams. Numbers indicate the number of transcripts common or unique to each knockdown. Complete microarray data is available at Dryad (Michaely et al., 2013). (B) Prolonged knockdown augments many protein and nucleic acid biosynthetic components. The percent of gene transcripts with either >20% increase or >20% decrease over no knockdown in heat maps for protein and nucleic acid synthesis are plotted. Heat maps are provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. (C) Knockdown increases fermentative glycolysis. Glucose consumption and lactate production were measured over 8 hr by colorimetric assay. Data are means ± SEM, n = 6. *p<0.05 as compared to No KD. H1299 cells serve as a positive control.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.00510.7554/eLife.00905.006Figure 3—figure supplement 1.Heat maps of gene transcripts involved in protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis.Heat maps were generated using ratios of mean transcript levels in 3-day, 8-day and 15-day knockdowns relative to no knockdown and masking these ratios onto KEGG pathway gene sets for protein and nucleic acid biosynthetic pathways. Colors in the heat map correspond to transcript ratios as follows: <0.4, dark blue; 0.4-0.56, blue; 0.56-0.8, cyan; 0.8-1.25, green; 1.25-1.75, yellow; 1.75-2.5, orange; and >2.5, red. Genes with multiple transcripts in the microarray were summed prior to ratio comparison.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.00610.7554/eLife.00905.007Figure 4.MEFs from Cavin-3 KO animals recapitulate phenotypes observed following long-term knockdown in human fibroblasts.(A) Diagram of the targeting strategy used to generate germline knockout of the Prkcdbp (cavin-3) gene. SA and LA indicate short arm and long arm regions of homology used for homologous recombination. Recombination replaced exon 1, most of exon 2 and the intron between the two coding exons with the neomycin resistance cassette. (B) Protein profiles of MEFs show that Cavin-3 KO MEFs have changes in protein distribution with respect to WT MEFs that are similar to the changes observed in human fibroblasts following 15-day knockdown. (C) Quantification of pERK and pAkt changes show that Cavin-3 KO MEFs have fourfold more pAkt and 3.7-fold less pERK than WT MEFs. Data are means ± SEM, n = 3. *p<0.05 as compared to WT MEFs. (D) Cavin-3 KO MEFs are more resistant to PD98059 and more sensitive to LY294002 than WT MEFs. Data are means ± SEM, n = 6. (E) Cavin-3 KO MEFs proliferate faster that WT MEFs. (F) Cavin-3 KO MEFs are more glycolytic than WT MEFs. Data are means ± SEM, n = 6. *p<0.05 as compared to WT MEFs. (G) Cavin-3 KO MEFs are more resistant to TNFα than WT MEFs. Arrow indicates cleaved PARP1. TUNEL data are means ± SEM from three independent experiments. *p<0.05 as compared to no TNFα. All assays were performed as in Figures 1-3.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.007 The major finding of this study is that the tumor suppressor protein, cavin-3, controls the balance between ERK and Akt signaling with consequences for cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis (Figures 1-4, 7). Cavin-3 promotes ERK signaling by anchoring the ERK activation module of caveolae to F-actin at the plasma membrane (Figures 5 and 6) and suppresses Akt signaling by promoting EGR1 and PTEN expression (Figures 7 and 8). The in vitro consequences of loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism, faster cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (Figures 1-4, 7). The in vivo consequences of loss of cavin-3 include elevated use of glycolysis and cachexia (Figure 9). The following antibodies were used in this study. Anti-EGFR; Anti-phospho-EGFR (pY1068); Anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (pT202/pY204); Anti-PTEN; Anti-phospho-Akt1 (pS473); Anti-Akt1; Anti-MEK1/2; Anti-survivin; Anti-PARP1; and Anti-c-Fos, (all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); Anti-caveolin-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA); Anti-(human cavin-3) (Bethyl Labs, Montgomery, TX); Anti-(mouse cavin-3) (Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL); Anti-ERK1/2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA); Anti-HIF1α (Bethyl Labs); Anti-Cavin-1 (AbCam, Cambridge, MA); Anti-Myo1c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Anti-Tubulin; and Anti-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Cavin-3 is a tumor suppressor protein of unknown function. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling. Loss of cavin-3 increases Akt signaling at the expense of ERK, while gain of cavin-3 increases ERK signaling at the expense Akt. Cavin-3 facilitates signal transduction to ERK by anchoring caveolae to the membrane skeleton of the plasma membrane via myosin-1c. Caveolae are lipid raft specializations that contain an ERK activation module and loss of the cavin-3 linkage reduces the abundance of caveolae, thereby separating this ERK activation module from signaling receptors. Loss of cavin-3 promotes Akt signaling through suppression of EGR1 and PTEN. The in vitro consequences of the loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), accelerated cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. The in vivo consequences of cavin-3 knockout are increased lactate production and cachexia.
The plasma membrane separates cells from their environment, and surface receptors in this membrane allow cells to respond to changes in their environment by converting external cues into intracellular signals. This process, which is known as signal transduction, plays a central role in the biology of cells, and abnormal signaling is a common cause of human disease. In cancer for example, signals tend to be too strong or they are sent at the wrong time.
