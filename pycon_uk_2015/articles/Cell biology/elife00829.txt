 Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), the major route of internalisation for transmembrane proteins into mammalian cells, controls many cellular processes from signalling and growth, to cell motility and organelle identity (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011). It has been known for decades that CME, like many other cellular processes, is inhibited during the early stages of mitosis (Fawcett, 1965; Berlin and Oliver, 1980; Warren, 1993; Fielding et al., 2012; Fielding and Royle, 2013). However, the mechanism that underlies this mitotic inhibition is unclear (Fielding and Royle, 2013). Previous reports indicated that due to osmotic changes in mitosis, the plasma membrane tension is increased (Raucher and Sheetz, 1999; Stewart et al., 2011b). We began by verifying this observation in HeLa cells. To measure apparent membrane tension, a polystyrene bead coated with concanavalin A was held in an optical trap, attached to the plasma membrane, and then pulled away from the cell surface to form a membrane tether (Dai and Sheetz, 1995; Figure 1A,B). The displacement of the bead from the trap centre is the tether force and this is proportional to the plasma membrane tension (Figure 1A). We found that the tether force was increased from 19.2 plus-minus 1.5 pN in interphase cells to 27 plus-minus 2.8 pN in mitotic cells at metaphase (mean plus-minus SEM, p=0.027, Figure 1C). These measurements are in good agreement with previous measurements in other cell types (Raucher and Sheetz, 1999). Tether force is related to the force required to invaginate a clathrin-coated vesicle. This means that, in mitotic cells, comparatively more energy is required from the CME machinery as it tries to overcome an increased load. The shortfall in this energy may explain mitotic shutdown of CME and the question is: what is the molecular basis of this shortfall?10.7554/eLife.00829.003Figure 1.Membrane tension in mitotic cells is elevated.(A) Schematic diagram to show the principle of using tether force to measure membrane tension. Displacement of the bead from the trap centre (Δx) can be converted to a tether force measurement (pN) as the stiffness of the trap is known. This tether force is proportional to the membrane tension. (B) Still video image of a membrane tension measurement in a mitotic cell. Note the thin tether is formed by moving the cell away from the bead held in the trap. (C) A typical trace showing bead displacement from the trap centre and the tether force. The cell was moved towards the bead (down arrow) to eliminate tension and give a zero value. The cell is then moved away (up arrow) and tether force is re-established.

HIP1 tagged at the N-terminus with tdTomato was a kind gift from Uri Ashery (Tel Aviv University). GFP-tagged clathrin light chain a (GFP-LCa) was available from previous work (Royle et al., 2005). GFP-tagged Human Ect2 (isoform 2) and Rap1 plasmids, pRK5-Rap1-Q63E and pRK5-Rap1-S17A were kind gifts from Buzz Baum (MRC-LMCB, London, UK) (Dao et al., 2009). For Ect2 rescue experiments, siRNA resistant forms of GFP-Ect2 were made introducing silent mutations in the Ect2 siRNA target regions by site-directed mutagenesis. GFP-Rap1Q63E was constructed by digestion of pRK5-Rap1Q63E with EcoRI and ligation into pEGFP-C3. Rap1 constructs were expressed for 42 hr. The following siRNAs were used: CTTN (QIAGEN, UK Hs_CTTN_5 SI02661960 or Hs_CTTN_6 SI02662485), Ect2 (QIAGEN, Hs_ECT2_5 SI02643067 or Hs_ECT2_6 SI03049249) at 100 nM for ∼66 hr or 42 hr, respectively.
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major internalisation route for many different receptor types in mammalian cells. CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. In this study, we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be ‘restarted’ in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown.
The plasma membrane that surrounds a cell acts as a protective barrier that regulates what can enter or exit the cell. However, large molecules and other ‘cargo’ can get into a cell in a variety of ways. One of these routes—known as clathrin-mediated endocytosis—involves a receptor on the outside of the membrane grabbing hold of the cargo while a protein called clathrin forms a ‘pit’ beneath the receptor. This pit becomes deeper and deeper until the cargo is completely surrounded by clathrin-lined membrane and is brought inside the cell.
