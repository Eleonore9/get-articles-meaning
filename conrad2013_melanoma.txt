The inability of targeted BRAF inhibitors to produce long-lasting improvement in the clinical outcome of melanoma highlights a need to identify additional approaches to inhibit melanoma growth. Recent studies have shown that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway decreases tumor growth and cooperates with ERK/MAPK pathway inhibitors to promote apoptosis in melanoma. Therefore, the identification of Wnt/β-catenin regulators may advance the development of new approaches to treat this disease. In order to move towards this goal we performed a large scale small-interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for regulators of β-catenin activated reporter activity in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Integrating large scale siRNA screen data with phosphoproteomic data and bioinformatics enrichment identified a protein, FAM129B, as a potential regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.  Functionally, we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of FAM129B in A375 and A2058 melanoma cell lines inhibits WNT3A-mediated activation of a β-catenin-responsive luciferase reporter and inhibits expression of the endogenous Wnt/β-catenin target gene, AXIN2. We also demonstrate that FAM129B knockdown inhibits apoptosis in melanoma cells treated with WNT3A. These experiments support a role for FAM129B in linking Wnt/β-catenin signaling to apoptosis in melanoma.
