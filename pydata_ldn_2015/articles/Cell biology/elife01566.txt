 Cilia and flagella are hair-like microtubule-based organelles, which protrude from the cell surface. Cilia and flagella are basically similar structures and are present in organisms as diverse as single-celled eukaryotes and humans. Cilia have two major physiological functions. One function is producing a driving force for locomotion or making fluid flow (Ostrowski et al., 2011; Vincensini et al., 2011). The other function is sensing extracellular signals and environments, such as hedgehog signaling and fluid flow (Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Drummond, 2012). Because these ciliary functions are important for development and physiology, defects in cilia structure or function cause multiple human diseases (ciliopathies), such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, polycystic kidney disease, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and Joubert syndrome (Badano et al., 2006; Tobin and Beales, 2009; Hildebrandt et al., 2011). Despite the importance of cilia, the mechanisms that assemble such complex structures are not fully understood. In a previous report, we performed proteomic analysis of primary cilia from mouse cells and identified 195 proteins as candidate cilia proteins (Ishikawa et al., 2012). We compared identified proteins with other published systematic studies of cilia, such as proteomic, comparative genomic, and promoter analyses of cilia, in various organisms (Ostrowski et al., 2002; Avidor-Reiss et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004; Blacque et al., 2005; Efimenko et al., 2005; Pazour et al., 2005; Stolc et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Arnaiz et al., 2009; Ishikawa et al., 2012), and found that some proteins in our candidate list had also been identified in other types of systematic studies of cilia. These proteins are presumably of particular importance to the function or assembly of cilia. We focused on one of the identified proteins, TTC26, which is a homologue of C. elegans DYF-13 (Blacque et al., 2005) and T. brucei PIFTC3 (Absalon et al., 2008; Franklin and Ullu, 2010). TTC26 has tetratricopeptide repeat motifs and is highly conserved not only in vertebrates but also in a variety of ciliated organisms (Figure 1A). Orthologs were not found in nonciliated organisms. Mouse TTC26 shows 58% amino acid identity and 73% similarity with the C. reinhardtii homologue. Endogenous mouse TTC26, detected by antibody staining, exclusively localized to primary cilia and basal bodies in IMCD3 cells, which derived from mouse kidney collecting ducts (Figure 1B). Endogenous TTC26 showed punctate localizations along the length of the primary cilium, resembling the pattern usually seen with IFT proteins.10.7554/eLife.01566.003Figure 1.TTC26 is a conserved ciliary protein.(A) Phylogenetic tree of TTC26 in various ciliated organisms.

Bar: 5 μm.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01566.003 In this study, we analyzed TTC26/DYF13 in mammalian cells, zebrafish, and C. reinhardtii and found that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein but, unlike other IFT B proteins, it is not required for IFT complex B assembly or motion or for ciliogenesis in general, but rather is specialized for transport of a specific set of ciliary cargo proteins related to motility. We suggest calling this protein IFT56 based on its molecular weight (Figure 3D), following standard nomenclature for IFT proteins (Cole et al., 1998; Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002). Rabbit polyclonal mouse TTC26 and C. reinhardtii DYF13 antibodies were raised against a bacterially expressed polypeptide corresponding to residues 312-427 of mouse TTC26 and synthesized peptide of N-terminal 15 amino acids of C. reinhardtii DYF13 (MFYSKSRPQHAARTN; Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Canadensis, PA). Commercial antibodies, anti-acetylated tubulin (6-11B-1), α-tubulin (DM1A), and actin (AC-15) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Antibodies against C. reinhardtii proteins IFT22, IFT27, IFT46, IFT70, IFT74/72, IFT81, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, IFT172, KAP, and D1BLIC were previously reported (Cole et al., 1998; Hou et al., 2004, 2007; Qin et al., 2004, 2007; Mueller et al., 2005; Fan et al., 2010; Behal et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2012).
Cilia/flagella are assembled and maintained by the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT), a highly conserved mechanism involving more than 20 IFT proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unclear. To help address this issue, we focused on a putative IFT protein TTC26/DYF13. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches we show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii, produced short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated a particular set of proteins involved in motility was specifically depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.
Sperm cells have tails called flagella that propel them towards an egg. Other cells have similar, but shorter, structures called cilia that sway back and forth on their surface. In addition to sweeping dust and debris out of our lungs and airways, cilia have a number of other crucial roles during development. This means that faulty cilia can lead to serious birth defects, as well as diseases of the kidneys and respiratory system.
