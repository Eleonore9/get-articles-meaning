 The proper folding of proteins is essential to cellular homeostasis, and an extensive collection of protein quality control (PQC) pathways, known as the proteostasis network, has evolved to protect nascent and metastable proteins from misfolding and to reactivate or remove proteins that have already misfolded (Powers et al., 2009; Wolff et al., 2014). The PQC network is tailored to buffer protein folding in a distinct homeostatic niche but can adapt when these buffering thresholds are exceeded by elevating the expression of PQC factors, including proteases and molecular chaperones, to clear accumulating misfolded proteins (Morimoto, 2008; Powers et al., 2009). In cases such as thermal stress, these corrections are sufficient to restore balance, but in others such as aging, misfolded proteins assemble into ordered amyloid aggregates, which persist and dramatically alter cellular physiology by inducing disease (Tuite and Serio, 2010; Voisine et al., 2010; Taylor and Dillin, 2011; Kim et al., 2013). This proteostasis collapse has been linked to the unique ability of amyloids to incorporate and conformationally convert like protein to the misfolded state and to their high thermodynamic stability (Chiti and Dobson, 2006; Jahn and Radford, 2008). Together, these properties are thought to enhance the production and restrict the resolution of the misfolded protein to the point that the buffering capacity and adaptability of the proteostasis network is chronically exceeded. Under normal growth conditions, [PSI+] propagates faithfully (Cox, 1965; Derkatch et al., 1996). However, at elevated temperatures where the PQC capacity is increased, [PSI+] becomes destabilized in a Sup35 conformation-specific manner. For example, the more thermodynamically stable but less efficiently propagated [PSI+]Weak variant is quantitatively ‘cured’ (i.e. converted to the non-prion [psi−] state) at elevated temperature in comparison with [PSI+]Strong, whose propagation is unaltered under the same conditions (Cox et al., 1988; Derkatch et al., 1996; Jung et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 2006; Newnam et al., 2011). This curing of [PSI+]Weak was linked to the inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp104 (Newnam et al., 2011), an observation that is seemingly counter to the idea that proteostasis capacity increases in response to stress (Morimoto, 2011). However, in this study, stationary phase cultures were only briefly diluted into fresh medium to re-establish exponential growth before exposure to elevated temperature (Newnam et al., 2011). Because stationary phase alters chaperone expression and blocks [PSI+] curing at elevated temperature (Gasch et al., 2000; Newnam et al., 2011), residual effects from the growth phase switch could alter the interaction between Sup35 aggregates and PQC factors. Therefore, we revisited the effects of elevated temperature on [PSI+] propagation, beginning with exponentially growing cultures. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of the molecular chaperone Hsp104, even at its low basal level, reduces organismal fitness at the normal growth temperature; however, survival at elevated temperatures is absolutely dependent on Hsp104, whose expression is induced to high levels by heat shock (Sanchez et al., 1992; Escusa-Toret et al., 2013). Thus, cell-based limitations must finely tune proteostasis capacity not only to control protein misfolding induced by stress but also to allow normal protein folding in the absence of these challenges (Morimoto, 2008). Using the yeast prion [PSI+] as a model to understand the in vivo interactions between amyloid and PQC pathways, we have uncovered one such pathway. While [PSI+]Weak is mitotically stable at the normal growth temperature (∼3% loss) (Derkatch et al., 1996), a transient sub-lethal thermal stress induces quantitative curing (Figure 1 and Figure 8) through the disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid by Hsp104 (Figures 1, 2 and 8). Our studies indicate that the increase in Hsp104 expression at elevated temperature alone is not sufficient to induce Sup35 amyloid resolution and [PSI+]Weak curing (Figures 1, 3). Rather, Hsp104 must engage heat-induced protein aggregates for a period that exceeds the time to the next cell division (Figures 7, 8). As a result, Hsp104 is asymmetrically localized to the cells that experienced the thermal stress (Figures 5, 8), and this increase in chaperone accumulation, along with its activity, promotes curing in the same cells (Figures 5, 8). Thus, chaperone spatial engagement, substrate processing dynamics, and partitioning during cell division represent cell based limitations on proteostasis capacity.10.7554/eLife.04288.016Figure 8.Model for Sup35 amyloid resolubilization and curing upon thermal stress.Upon thermal stress, cellular proteins (green) misfold and aggregate, leading to the induction and recruitment of Hsp104 (barrel). If thermal stress occurs in unbudded cells (1), these aggregates are resolved prior to cell division, allowing the partitioning of Hsp104 to both mother (black) and daughter (gray) cells (left). If thermal stress occurs in budded cells (2), heat-induced aggregates persist upon cell division (3), leading to the asymmetric retention of Hsp104 in mother cells. Both heat-induced aggregates (green) and Sup35 amyloid (blue corkscrews) are resolved in cells accumulating high levels of Hsp104, leading to curing (red, 4).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04288.016 All plasmids used in this study were previously reported (Table 2) except for SB1013 (pRS306PGPD-FFL-mCherry), which contains firefly luciferase as an Xba1/BamHI fragment and mCherry as a BamHI/XhoI fragment, separated by a three-repeat glycine-serine linker. The ORFs were amplified by PCR using primers 5XbaI firefly/3BamHI firefly and 5BamHIGS3mCherry/3XhoImCherry, respectively (Table 3) and confirmed by sequencing. All strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this study are derivatives of 74-D694 (Table 4) (Chernoff et al., 1995). A WT [PSI+]Weak diploid strain (SY945) was generated by mating SY2600 with SLL3252 (Table 4). The diploid state was confirmed by sporulation. SY591, a [PSI+]Weak strain containing a heterozygous deletion of HSP104, was created by transformation of a PvuI-BamHI fragment of pYABL5 (a kind gift of S. Lindquist) into SY945 and selection on medium lacking leucine. Disruptions were verified by PCR and 2:2 marker segregation upon sporulation and dissection. SY957, a [PSI+]Strong diploid strain containing a heterozygous disruption of SUP35, was created by transforming a PCR-generated cassette using pFA6a-KanMX4 as a template with primers SD27 and SD28 (Table 3) into SLL3071 (Table 4). Integration was confirmed by PCR using primers Psup352/PTEFCH and Sup35 3′chk/pFa6 test (Table 3). The galactose-inducible HSP104 strains were made by integrating BstBI-linearized SB630 (Table 2) into SY197 (Table 4) and selecting transformants on medium lacking uracil. Galactose-inducible expression of Hsp104 was confirmed by western blotting. [PSI+]Strong and [PSI+]Weak were then cytoduced into this strain from SY1698 and SY1699, respectively, to create SY1748 and SY1749 (Table 4), respectively (Conde and Fink, 1976). Cytoductants were selected by growth on synthetic medium containing glycerol and lacking uracil and by colony color on YPD. The HSP104-GFP [psi−] strain (SY2125) was created by transforming a PCR-generated cassette using pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-KanMX6 as a template with primers HSP104-GFP F-A and HSP104-GFP R-A (Table 3) into WT [PSI+]Strong strains and selection on medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. Integration was confirmed by PCR using primers Hsp104for/GFP-R and pFa6 test/Hsp104 3 flank R (Table 3), and expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. These strains were cured of the prion by growth on YPD plates containing 3 mM GdnHCl (Tuite et al., 1981). The [PSI+]Weak variant (SY2126) was generated by mating SY2125 to a WT [PSI+]Weak strain (SLL2600) and sporulation. Tetrads were dissected to recover haploids, and HSP104-GFP isolates were verified by G418 resistance, fluorescence microscopy, and quantitative immunoblotting for Hsp104. The heat inducible GFP strain (SY2091) was generated by transformation of a WT [psi−] strain (SLL2119) with Bsu36I-digested SB849 (Table 2). Expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. SSA1-GFP (SY2658) and SIS1-GFP (SY2447) [PSI+]Weak strains were created by transforming PCR-generated cassettes using pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-KanMX6 as a template with primers GFP-GS-Ssa1-F/GFP-Ssa1-R or Sis1-GFP-F GS/Sis1-GFP-R (Table 3), respectively, into WT [PSI+]Strong strains and selection on medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. Expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative immunoblotting for Ssa1/2 and Sis1, respectively. These strains were cured of the prion by growth on YPD plates containing 3 mM GdnHCl, mitochondrial loss was induced by growth in 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and [PSI+]Weak was transferred to them by cytoduction (Cox, 1965), using SY1699 as a donor strain. Cytoductants were selected by growth on glycerol medium and 300 μg/ml G418. SSA1-GFP and SIS1-GFP [PSI+]Weak strains containing a nuclear-localized fluorescent reporter protein (DsRed-NLS, SY2659, and SY485, respectively) were generated by transforming SY2658 or SY2447 with Bsu36I-digested SB503 (Table 2). Expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. The Δbni1 [PSI+]Weak strain (SY1888) was created by transforming a PCR-generated cassette using pFA6a-KanMX4 as a template with primers AD-BNI1-f and AD-BNI1-r (Table 3) into a [PSI+]Weak diploid (SY782, a cross between SY2600 and SY86, Table 4). Transformants were selected on medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 and verified by PCR using primers AD-BNI1-fseq/PTEFCH and AD-BNI1-rseq/pFa6 test (Table 3). The haploid Δbni1 [PSI+]Weak strain was then generated by sporulation and tetrad dissection and verified by G418 resistance. The HSP104-GFP Δbni1 [PSI+]Weak strain (SY2486) was created by transforming SY2126 with a PCR-generated cassette using pFA6a-hphMX4 as a template with primers AD-BNI1-f and AD-BNI1-r (Table 3). Transformants were confirmed by PCR using primers AD-BNI1-fseq/PTEFCH and AD-BNI1-rseq/pFa6 test (Table 4) and growth on YPD plates containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B.10.7554/eLife.04288.017Table

The proteostasis network has evolved to support protein folding under normal conditions and to expand this capacity in response to proteotoxic stresses. Nevertheless, many pathogenic states are associated with protein misfolding, revealing in vivo limitations on quality control mechanisms. One contributor to these limitations is the physical characteristics of misfolded proteins, as exemplified by amyloids, which are largely resistant to clearance. However, other limitations imposed by the cellular environment are poorly understood. To identify cell-based restrictions on proteostasis capacity, we determined the mechanism by which thermal stress cures the [PSI+]/Sup35 prion. Remarkably, Sup35 amyloid is disassembled at elevated temperatures by the molecular chaperone Hsp104. This process requires Hsp104 engagement with heat-induced non-prion aggregates in late cell-cycle stage cells, which promotes its asymmetric retention and thereby effective activity. Thus, cell division imposes a potent limitation on proteostasis capacity that can be bypassed by the spatial engagement of a quality control factor.
Proteins must fold into specific shapes to work inside cells, and the misfolding of proteins is associated with a growing number of diseases. For example, prions are misfolded proteins that form insoluble aggregates called amyloids. These aggregates are not easily destroyed and can cause other nearby proteins to misfold and join the amyloid. This process of amyloid assembly leads to progressive diseases such as mad cow disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, which are collectively known as amyloidoses.
