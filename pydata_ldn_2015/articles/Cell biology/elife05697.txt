 Skeletal muscle fibre formation requires a coordinated programme of morphological and biochemical changes in the differentiating cells. Upon differentiation, mono-nucleated myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and fuse to form syncytial myotubes (Wakelam, 1985). The microtubule cytoskeleton is required for these processes (Bischoff and Holtzer, 1968; Holtzer et al., 1975; Toyama et al., 1982) and undergoes reorganisation into an array of paraxial microtubules (Warren, 1974), which serves as template for contractile sarcomere formation (Antin et al., 1981; Pizon et al., 2005). To characterise microtubule organisation in differentiating muscle cells, we determined filament orientation, motility, and growth characteristics of microtubules at different stages during differentiation of C2C12 cells. As reported previously, we found that microtubule organisation changes from a radial, centrosome-dominated array in undifferentiated cells, to a paraxial array in myotubes (Figure 1A) (Warren, 1974; Tassin et al., 1985). Microtubule growth directionality relative to the longitudinal axis of the cell was determined by tracking EB3-tdTomato-labelled microtubule ends. The asymmetry in the distribution of microtubule growth angles increases significantly during the first two days of differentiation (Figure 1B-D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This suggests that guided growth of microtubules (probably along existing microtubules) contributes to the progressively more ordered parallel microtubule array in differentiating cells. Furthermore, microtubules within the array are highly motile in undifferentiated myoblasts as visualised by the photoactivation of paGFP-Tubulin or conversion of mEos2-Tubulin (Figure 1E,F, Videos 1, 2). In differentiating muscle cells, microtubules become very stable and static as seen by the low frequency and speed of microtubule-sliding movements and by diminished loss of microtubules from the photoactivated region due to depolymerisation (Figure 1E-H, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Video 3). The reduction in microtubule movements could be due to the differential regulation of motors that drive microtubule sliding. Conventional kinesin as well as dynein has been implicated in microtubule-microtubule sliding and microtubule movement along the cell cortex in other cell systems (Rusan et al., 2002; Fink and Steinberg, 2006; Straube et al., 2006; Bicek et al., 2009; Jolly et al., 2010; Samora et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2013). Both motors contribute to microtubule movements in myoblasts as the frequency of microtubule movements was reduced more than threefold upon depletion of either dynein heavy chain or Kif5b (Figure 1E-H, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Videos 4, 5). However, Kif5b and dynein were continuously expressed during muscle differentiation (Figure 1I), suggesting that other factors prevent motor-dependent microtubule sliding and promote parallel microtubule array formation during myogenesis.10.7554/eLife.05697.003Figure 1.Microtubules are arranged in stable paraxial arrays during muscle cell differentiation.(A) Structured illumination microscopy of anti-tubulin-stained C2C12 cells pre/post induction of muscle differentiation as indicated.

Microtubules are the stiffest of the cytoskeletal polymers that can bear high-compressive loads, especially when reinforced laterally (Brangwynne et al., 2006). Our data support a model in which microtubules fulfil a structural role during the elongation of muscle cells. If so, one would expect that the degree of alignment of microtubules will correlate with a cell's ability to elongate. We tested this by plotting the Kuiper statistic as a measure of microtubule orderliness against the mean cell length of 48 hr differentiated cells for different RNAi treatments used in this study and found indeed a linear correlation (Figure 8A). Likewise, the depletion of mMAP4, which increases the length of differentiating myoblasts also increases the paraxial microtubule alignment beyond that of control cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). These data support the idea that MT orientation is strongly linked to the morphological changes required for muscle differentiation. As observed for oMAP4, our previously published data on EB3 depletion (Straube and Merdes, 2007) and a number of unpublished observations, myoblasts that fail to elongate are also impaired in cell-cell fusion. While we don't yet understand the relationship between cell elongation and fusion, a mechanism to prevent the fusion of myoblasts that did not complete the previous step of differentiation, makes intuitively sense. oMAP4-depleted cells show in addition to impaired morphological changes, also a delay in the expression of myogenic markers, such as myogenin and embryonic myosin, further suggesting that a signalling step in the differentiation programme has not been completed. Microtubules have been implicated in a signalling role during myogenesis based on the observation that altering the level of posttranslational tubulin modifications either through chemical inhibition or depletion of microtubule-stabilising MAPs leads to similar delays in the expression of differentiation markers and impaired formation of myotubes (Spencer et al., 2000; Chang et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2009). The depletion of oMAP4 does not negatively affect tubulin acetylation (Figure 3F) but might impact other aspects of this putative microtubule-dependent signalling event. It will be a future challenge to elucidate the pathway that couples microtubule organisation and chemical modification to the timing of the myogenic protein expression programme.10.7554/eLife.05697.037Figure 8.oMAP4 and dynein co-operate in the organisation of the paraxial microtubule network in differentiating muscle cells.(A) Kuiper statistics of traced microtubule filaments as in Figures 3G, 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 as a measure for microtubule orderliness is plotted against the mean cell length of 48 hr differentiated C2C12 myoblasts treated with shRNAs as indicated. A linear fit to the data is shown. (B) We propose that the correlation between the precision of paraxial alignment and cell elongation suggests that ordered microtubule arrays confer higher mechanical stability to counteract contractile forces. (C) Model of cooperation of oMAP4-mediated zippering with motor-driven microtubule sliding/transport in the formation of a highly ordered paraxial microtubule network. Microtubules are indicated in green, oMAP4 in magenta, dynein in blue, and kinesin in purple.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05697.037 RNA was extracted from 0 to 60 hr differentiated C2C12 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, UK), and random-primed cDNA was synthesized using RevertAid H Minus M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, Fisher Scientific, UK) according to manufacturer's protocol. PCR reactions were carried out using cDNA timecourse samples as templates, isoform-specific upstream primers GCCAGCCTTCTGAGCCTTG (for uMAP4), GAGATCCAAGATGTTCAAGTC (for mMAP4), and CTGTTGGAAGAGACCCCAC (for oMAP4) and downstream primers CAGCTGGCACTGAGCCTG (to determine relative expression levels) and GAAGGGCCTCACTGCCAC (to determine number of microtubule binding repeats). As control, the coding sequence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified using the primers CCCACTTGAAGGGTGGAG and CAGGCGGCACGTCAGATC.
The microtubule cytoskeleton is critical for muscle cell differentiation and undergoes reorganisation into an array of paraxial microtubules, which serves as template for contractile sarcomere formation. In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterised isoform of microtubule-associated protein MAP4, oMAP4, as a microtubule organising factor that is crucial for myogenesis. We show that oMAP4 is expressed upon muscle cell differentiation and is the only MAP4 isoform essential for normal progression of the myogenic differentiation programme. Depletion of oMAP4 impairs cell elongation and cell-cell fusion. Most notably, oMAP4 is required for paraxial microtubule organisation in muscle cells and prevents dynein- and kinesin-driven microtubule-microtubule sliding. Purified oMAP4 aligns dynamic microtubules into antiparallel bundles that withstand motor forces in vitro. We propose a model in which the cooperation of dynein-mediated microtubule transport and oMAP4-mediated zippering of microtubules drives formation of a paraxial microtubule array that provides critical support for the polarisation and elongation of myotubes.
Skeletal muscles—which enable animals to move—are made up of large elongated muscle cells that span the entire length of the muscle. These cells contain stacks of structures called sarcomeres that enable the cells to contract and generate the force required for movement.
