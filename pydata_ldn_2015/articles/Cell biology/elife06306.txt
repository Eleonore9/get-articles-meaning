 In eukaryotes, most integral membrane proteins are synthesized, integrated into the membrane, and folded properly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Molecular chaperones and folding enzymes are required for the folding of the integral membrane proteins in the ER. A comprehensive approach in yeast to identify genes required for protein folding in the ER identified the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), which comprises six subunits (Jonikas et al., 2009). Another report studying the comprehensive interaction map of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery revealed that EMC contains four and three additional subunits in mammals and Drosophila, respectively (Christianson et al., 2011). The deletions of each emc1-6 gene causes the unfolded protein response (UPR), presumably caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins (Jonikas et al., 2009). Meanwhile, a recent study showed that EMC also facilitates lipid transfer from ER to mitochondria (Lahiri et al., 2014). Retinal mosaic screening using the FLP/FRT method and two-color fluorescent live imaging was used to identify the genes essential for Rh1 maturation and transport (Satoh et al., 2013). For selected lines exhibiting defects in Rh1 accumulation in the live imaging screening, the immunocytochemical distribution of Rh1 was investigated to evaluate the phenotype with respect to transport and morphogenesis (Table 2, Satoh et al., 2013). Among them, CG6750e02662 (Kyoto stock number: 114504) exhibits severe Arrestin2::GFP and Rh1 reduction in rhabdomeres (Figure 1A,C) with normal ommatidial organization. CG6750e02662 has an insertion of a piggyBac transposon right downstream of the stop codon of CG6750 (Figure 1B). The phenotype was reverted by the precise excision of the piggyBac transposon or transgenically-expressed CG6750 (data not shown); this indicates Rh1 reduction is caused by reduced CG6750 gene function. CG6750 shares 65% identity and 82% similarity with zebrafish pob and 27% identity and 44% similarity with yeast EMC3. Because CG6750 is likely to be the homolog of zebrafish pob, we designated CG6750 as ‘dPob’ and analyzed its functions in Rh1 transport and retinal morphogenesis.10.7554/eLife.06306.003Figure 1.Identification of CG6750 as an essential gene for rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) biosynthesis.(A) Observation of fluorescent protein localizations in CG6750e02662 mosaic retinas by the water immersion technique.

Scale bar: 5 μm (A, C, D).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06306.003 The present study shows that dPob, the Drosophila homolog of a subunit of EMC, EMC3, localizes in the ER and is essential for Rh1 accumulation of the rhabdomeres. The deficiency of each of two other EMC subunits, EMC1 and EMC8/9, also shows absence of Rh1 on the rhabdomeres. Mammalian EMC8 and EMC9 were identified together with EMC7 and EMC10 by high-content proteomics strategy (Christianson et al., 2011). Unlike EMC1−6 subunits, EMC8 and EMC9 do not have a transmembrane helix or signal peptide and no experimental data have been reported to show the functions of these subunits. We observed that Drosophila EMC8/9-deficient cells lack accumulation of Rh1 apoprotein in the ER and impaired biosynthesis of the multi-pass transmembrane proteins. These phenotypes in EMC8/9 deficiency are indistinguishable from those in dPob and EMC1 mutant cells, suggesting that EMC8/9 work together with EMC1 and dPob. This is the first functional study of the additional subunits of EMC, which are lacking in yeast. Flies were reared at 20-25°C in 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycles and fed standard cornmeal/glucose/agar/yeast food unless noted otherwise. Vitamin A-deficient food contained 1% agar, 10% dry yeast, 10% sucrose, 0.02% cholesterol, 0.5% propionate, and 0.05% methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate.
In eukaryotes, most integral membrane proteins are synthesized, integrated into the membrane, and folded properly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We screened the mutants affecting rhabdomeric expression of rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) in the Drosophila photoreceptors and found that dPob/EMC3, EMC1, and EMC8/9, Drosophila homologs of subunits of ER membrane protein complex (EMC), are essential for stabilization of immature Rh1 in an earlier step than that at which another Rh1-specific chaperone (NinaA) acts. dPob/EMC3 localizes to the ER and associates with EMC1 and calnexin. Moreover, EMC is required for the stable expression of other multi-pass transmembrane proteins such as minor rhodopsins Rh3 and Rh4, transient receptor potential, and Na+K+-ATPase, but not for a secreted protein or type I single-pass transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, we found that dPob/EMC3 deficiency induces rhabdomere degeneration in a light-independent manner. These results collectively indicate that EMC is a key factor in the biogenesis of multi-pass transmembrane proteins, including Rh1, and its loss causes retinal degeneration.
The membranes that surround cells contain many proteins, and those that span the entire width of the membrane are known as transmembrane proteins. Rhodopsin is one such transmembrane protein that is found in the light-sensitive ‘photoreceptor’ cells of the eye, where it plays an essential role in vision.
