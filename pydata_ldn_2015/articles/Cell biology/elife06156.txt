 Extensive studies have shown the importance of precise cell fate decisions in many life activities, such as cell cycle entry in response to environmental changes and pattern formation during embryonic development (Xiong and Ferrell, 2003; Gregor et al., 2007; Balázsi et al., 2011). However, little is known about how cells utilize the information of the input signal to make robust and reliable decisions especially in cases of noisy and time-varying signals. We address this issue by using the Start transition in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model system. Start is a major cell cycle checkpoint in budding yeast (corresponding to the restriction point in mammalian cells), which decides whether or not the cell should make the irreversible commitment to the next round of division (Hartwell et al., 1974). The environmental and internal conditions are sensed and passed to the Start signal Cln3 (Gallego et al., 1997; Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997; Hall et al., 1998; Parviz et al., 1998; Menoyo et al., 2013). As a G1 cyclin, Cln3 triggers the Start transition by activating a downstream positive feedback loop composed of the repressor Whi5, the transcription factor SBF/MBF and the cyclin Cln1/2 (Skotheim et al., 2008; Charvin et al., 2010) (Figure 1A upper panel). The Start checkpoint coordinates cell growth and cell division and is thought to control the cell size under different growth conditions (Johnston et al., 1977; Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004). However, the mechanisms of the coordination and control have not been fully elucidated.10.7554/eLife.03977.003Figure 1.G1 length is inversely proportional to the average Cln3.(A) Schematic of the Start regulatory network in wild-type (upper panel) and in strains used in this study (lower panel).

The G1 length TG1 is defined as the time interval between Whi5 nuclear entry in late mitosis and its exclusion from the nucleus at the Start transition (Taberner et al., 2009) (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1), which is a measure for how long the cell waits to make the Start decision. Cln3 level under a synthetic inducible promoter GlacSpr (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) was controlled by titrating the inducer IPTG. The cells were grown in a microfluidic chip and monitored by time-lapse microscopy. We found that in both mother and daughter cells G1 length is prolonged as IPTG concentration decreases, which is consistent with the previous findings that increased Cln3 dosage shortens G1 length (Di Talia et al., 2007) and suggests a negative correlation between G1 length and Cln3 level (Figure 1C). Cellular decision making is a fundamental problem with broad implications, ranging from development, cell-fate determination, stress response, to cell cycle control and signaling. A decision-making process in a cell usually consists of (i) sensing (of external and/or internal signals and cues), (ii) information processing (of the sensed information), and (iii) actuating (e.g., turning on a switch). Previous works have been mainly focused on the first and the last steps. Even in many cases where the molecular players and the circuitry are mapped out, how cells process information to make the best decision is largely unknown. This is intrinsically a quantitative question and is especially important when the signals are noisy and with uncertainties. Information processing is the brain of decision making; understanding this step is critical to understand the rationale and the strategy the cell adopts to make better decisions. Standard methods were used throughout.
Cell fate decisions are critical for life, yet little is known about how their reliability is achieved when signals are noisy and fluctuating with time. In this study, we show that in budding yeast, the decision of cell cycle commitment (Start) is determined by the time integration of its triggering signal Cln3. We further identify the Start repressor, Whi5, as the integrator. The instantaneous kinase activity of Cln3-Cdk1 is recorded over time on the phosphorylated Whi5, and the decision is made only when phosphorylated Whi5 reaches a threshold. Cells adjust the threshold by modulating Whi5 concentration in different nutrient conditions to coordinate growth and division. Our work shows that the strategy of signal integration, which was previously found in decision-making behaviors of animals, is adopted at the cellular level to reduce noise and minimize uncertainty.
Budding yeast and other single-celled organisms can reproduce by dividing to produce two daughter cells. The timing of the cell division is critical because if the cell is still small when it divides, the resulting daughter cells may not be big enough to survive.
