 The active properties of neuronal dendrites are important for integrating and processing excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (Johnston et al., 1996; London and Hausser, 2005; Johnston and Narayanan, 2008; Major et al., 2013). Over the past few decades, dendritically generated Na+, Ca2+, and NMDA spikes have been identified in many types of neurons, both in vitro and in vivo (Llinas et al., 1968; Wong et al., 1979; Stuart and Sakmann, 1994; Chen et al., 1997; Schiller et al., 1997, 2000; Stuart et al., 1997a; Kamondi et al., 1998; Larkum et al., 1999; Waters et al., 2003; Larkum et al., 2007, 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013). One proposed function of dendritic Na+ spikes is to amplify synaptic potentials and facilitate somatic AP initiation (Hausser et al., 2000; London and Hausser, 2005). However, in most instances, dendritic Na+ spikes propagate poorly to the soma and so fail to act as reliable triggers of somatic APs (Stuart and Sakmann, 1994; Stuart et al., 1997a; Golding and Spruston, 1998). Indeed, under physiological conditions, the APs in most principal neurons, including neocortical layer 5 and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), are usually initiated at the axonal initial segment (AIS) before back-propagating to the dendrites (Stuart and Sakmann, 1994; Stuart et al., 1997a, 1997b; Golding and Spruston, 1998). Thus, whereas dendritic Na+ spikes can fine-tune neuronal output and regulate synaptic plasticity (Golding et al., 2002; Ariav et al., 2003; Jarsky et al., 2005; Remy and Spruston, 2007), it is less certain whether these spikes may serve as necessary events to allow synaptic input to trigger AP output (Hausser et al., 2000; Spruston, 2008). In this study, we report that dendritic Na+ spikes play an important role in the ability of hippocampal CA2 PNs to generate axonal AP output in response to synaptic input from the direct entorhinal cortical (EC) projections that terminate on CA2 PN distal dendrites. Our laboratory found that CA2 PNs receive strong excitatory inputs from EC and fire APs with high probability in response to a brief burst of stimuli delivered to the EC PP axons (5 pulses at 100 Hz). In contrast, the same PP stimuli generate a smaller synaptic response in CA1 PNs that is usually insufficient to elicit spike output (Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010). In this study, we first re-investigated the input-output relation between distal synaptic stimulation strength and sub-threshold EPSP size recorded in the soma of CA2 PNs. In these experiments the stimulation electrode was placed in SLM of the CA1 region as before but was closer to the CA1/CA2 border (∼50 µm) than in our previous study (∼200 µm). Consistent with our previous findings (Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010), the sub-threshold EPSP amplitude in CA2 PNs evoked by PP stimulation was 5-6 times larger than that observed in CA1 (Figure 1A-C). Moreover, the EPSP in CA2 PNs was slightly larger than that seen in our previous study, most likely due to the closer proximity to CA2 of the stimulation electrode.10.7554/eLife.04551.003Figure 1.A single stimulus delivered to the perforant path (PP) evokes APs in CA2 PNs.(A) Diagram illustrating the configuration for the experiment.

The dendritic Na+ spikes thus enable the cortical inputs to overcome their unfavorable distal dendritic location and effectively propagate cortical information by shortening spike latency and overcoming powerful inhibition. Our data further show that dendritic Na+ spikes enhance the temporal precision of CA2 PN AP output and are likely crucial for the function of the EC → CA2 → CA1 disynaptic pathway (Bartesaghi and Gessi, 2004; Bartesaghi et al., 2006; Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010). Given the recent findings that CA2 PNs are critical for social memory (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014), the dendritic Na+ spikes in these neurons are likely to play a key behavioral role. Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from 5- to 8-week old C57BL/6J male mice from the Jackson Laboratory, as described previously (Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010). In brief, animals were anesthetized and killed by decapitation in accordance with institutional regulations. Hippocampi were dissected out, and transverse slices (400 µm thickness) from the dorsal hippocampus were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1200S, Germany) in ice-cold dissection solution containing (in mM): 10 NaCl, 195 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 Na Pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl2, and 7 MgCl2. The slices were then incubated in 33°C ACSF (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 20 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 Na Pyruvate, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2) for 20-30 min and then kept at room temperature for at least 1.5 hr before transfer to the recording chamber. Cutting and recording solutions were both saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). All electrophysiological recording experiments were performed at 31-32°C. For some experiments, a cut was made between CA2 and CA3 regions.
Synaptic inputs from different brain areas are often targeted to distinct regions of neuronal dendritic arbors. Inputs to proximal dendrites usually produce large somatic EPSPs that efficiently trigger action potential (AP) output, whereas inputs to distal dendrites are greatly attenuated and may largely modulate AP output. In contrast to most other cortical and hippocampal neurons, hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons show unusually strong excitation by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, we demonstrate that the ability of these EC inputs to drive CA2 AP output requires the firing of local dendritic Na+ spikes. Furthermore, we find that CA2 dendritic geometry contributes to the efficient coupling of dendritic Na+ spikes to AP output. These results provide a striking example of how dendritic spikes enable direct cortical inputs to overcome unfavorable distal synaptic locale to trigger axonal AP output and thereby enable efficient cortico-hippocampal information flow.
Cells called neurons carry information—in the form of electrical signals—around the brain. These cells connect to each other in complex networks and each neuron is able to form junctions, or synapses, with many neighbors. In a neuron, small electrical signals start from synapses at the tips of branched structures called dendrites. From there, these signals travel to the cell body of the neuron to activate a larger electrical signal—called an action potential—that travels along a long tail-like extension, called the axon, to reach synapses with other neurons.
