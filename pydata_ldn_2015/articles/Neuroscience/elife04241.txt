 Mammals adopt different global states in response to threats or opportunities by coordinated changes in physiology and neurochemistry that optimize and focus their response to the situation at hand (LeDoux, 2012). Hallmarks of such global states include arousal, a reconfiguring of the relative importance given to different sensory cues, and altered physiology due to endocrine feedback (LeDoux, 2012). Examples of global states include those evoked by a potential mate (Pfaff et al., 2008), by predators (Martinez et al., 2008; Motta et al., 2009), or by nutritional state (Atasoy et al., 2012; Sternson et al., 2013). Understanding how global states are encoded in neural circuits is of interest because they may provide insights into subjective behaviors: for example, fear, aggression, and hunger (LeDoux, 2012; Damasio and Carvalho, 2013). We hypothesized that tonic signaling from the O2-sensing neurons URX, AQR, and PQR could reprogram gene expression according to ambient O2 levels. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the transcriptomes of npr-1(null) mutants (referred to as npr-1) and gcy-35; npr-1 young adult animals grown at 21% and 7% O2 using RNA sequencing (see ‘Materials and methods’). URX, AQR, and PQR neurons do not respond to O2 changes in gcy-35; npr-1 mutants, and exhibit activity levels found in npr-1 animals kept at 7% O2 (Persson et al., 2009; Zimmer et al., 2009; Busch et al., 2012). To prevent npr-1 animals from aggregating, which induces gene expression changes that would confound our analysis (Andersen et al., 2014), we grew animals at low density. We carried out three sets of comparisons. To identify genes whose expression is O2-modulated we compared the transcriptomes of npr-1 animals grown at 21% and 7% O2 (Supplementary file 1). To identify genes regulated by GCY-35-dependent signaling, we compared the transcriptomes of npr-1 and gcy-35; npr-1 animals grown at 21% O2 (Supplementary file 2). And to identify and exclude genes whose expression is altered by growth at different O2 levels independently of gcy-35, we compared the transcriptomes of gcy-35; npr-1 animals grown at 21% and 7% O2 (Supplementary file 3). We then intersected the three comparisons, using as a cut-off q value of 0.05 (see ‘Materials and methods’). If our hypothesis was correct, many of the genes identified as differentially expressed in Supplementary file 1 (npr-1 21% O2 vs npr-1 7% O2) should also be identified in Supplementary file 2 (npr-1 21% O2 vs gcy-35; npr-1 21% O2) but not in Supplementary file 3 (gcy-35; npr-1 21% O2 vs gcy-35; npr-1 7% O2). Consistent with this, we found that 152/210 genes differentially expressed between npr-1 7% O2 versus npr-1 21% O2 were also found in the gcy-35; npr-1 21% O2 versus npr-1 21% O2 comparison. Expression of 72/152 of these genes was not significantly altered by O2 experience in gcy-35; npr-1 animals (Supplementary file 4). For almost all of these genes, 71/72, disrupting gcy-35 had a similar effect on gene expression as growing npr-1 animals at 7% O2 (Supplementary file 4). Genes whose expression was regulated by O2 experience in a GCY-35-dependent way encoded proteins involved in metabolism (e.g., elo-6, a polyunsaturated fatty acid elongase; folt-2, a folate transporter; mai-2, a mitochondrial intrinsic ATPase inhibitor protein), oxidation-reduction reactions (e.g., the cytochrome p450s, cyp-35C1 and cyp-34A2), and proteolysis (e.g., the cathepsins cpr-4 and cpr-6), suggesting broad changes not limited to the nervous system (Supplementary file 4). We reverse engineer a neural circuit that controls the global state of C. elegans, enabling the animal to recognize 21% O2 and avoid, escape, and adapt to surface exposure (Figure 11). the URX, AQR, and PQR O2-sensing neurons are tonically stimulated by 21% O2, causing sustained changes in C. elegans behavior, gene expression, and circuit state. The RMG interneurons, connected to URX by gap junctions and reciprocal synapses, are activated by URX and drive an aroused locomotory state that promotes escape from high O2. Stimulating RMG using channelrhodopsin is sufficient to evoke rapid and sustained forward movement in animals kept at 7% O2, even if URX, AQR, and PQR are ablated. However, stimulating RMG does not elicit the transient avoidance responses evoked when C. elegans encounter an increase from 7% to 21% O2. Distinct circuits appear to coordinate the transient and persistent behavioral changes evoked by a rise in O2.10.7554/eLife.04241.019Figure 11.A model for the circuits controlling the behavioral switch.The URX O2-sensing neurons and the RMG interneurons tonically encode O2 concentration. These neurons communicate to downstream neurons predominantly through sustained changes in neuropeptide secretion. RMG is connected through gap junctions to sensory neurons that can act as shunts, downregulating RMG neurosecretion when the OCR-2 or TAX-4 cation channels they express are less active. URX-RMG output continuously modulates the activity of downstream neurons, including AIY and AVB, but these neurons also respond to other cues, and their activity at any time point reflects both O2 concentration and the behavior being executed. Increased activity of these neurons promotes rapid forward movement. Other neurons, such as AIA and AVA, participate in the execution of the behavioral state but do not appear to be under tonic control of the URX-RMG circuit.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04241.019 C. elegans was grown under standard conditions unless otherwise indicated (Sulston and Hodgkin, 1988). To cultivate animals in defined O2 environments, we used a Coy O2 control glove box (Coy, Grass Lake, Michigan, USA).
Brains organize behavior and physiology to optimize the response to threats or opportunities. We dissect how 21% O2, an indicator of surface exposure, reprograms C. elegans' global state, inducing sustained locomotory arousal and altering expression of neuropeptides, metabolic enzymes, and other non-neural genes. The URX O2-sensing neurons drive arousal at 21% O2 by tonically activating the RMG interneurons. Stimulating RMG is sufficient to switch behavioral state. Ablating the ASH, ADL, or ASK sensory neurons connected to RMG by gap junctions does not disrupt arousal. However, disrupting cation currents in these neurons curtails RMG neurosecretion and arousal. RMG signals high O2 by peptidergic secretion. Neuropeptide reporters reveal neural circuit state, as neurosecretion stimulates neuropeptide expression. Neural imaging in unrestrained animals shows that URX and RMG encode O2 concentration rather than behavior, while the activity of downstream interneurons such as AVB and AIY reflect both O2 levels and the behavior being executed.
From humans to worms, animals must respond appropriately to environmental challenges to survive. Starving animals must conserve energy while they seek food; animals that encounter a predator must fight or flee. These responses involve the animals re-programming their bodies and behavior, and, in humans, are thought to coincide with feelings or emotions such as ‘hunger’ and ‘fear’. Understanding these states in humans is difficult, but studies of simpler animals may provide some insights.
