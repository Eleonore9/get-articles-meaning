 Understanding the neural mechanisms of consciousness is a fundamental challenge of current neuroscience research. We note that precise definitions of the words ‘consciousness’ and ‘unconsciousness’ remain ambiguous. However, loss of voluntary response in a task is an effective and clinically relevant definition of unconsciousness. Over the past decade, important insights have been gained by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the brain during sleep, and disorders of consciousness (DOC) such as coma, vegetative states, and minimally conscious states (Greicius et al., 2008; Horovitz et al., 2008; Boly et al., 2009; Cauda et al., 2009; Horovitz et al., 2009; Larson-Prior et al., 2009; Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010; Samann et al., 2011; Fernandez-Espejo et al., 2012; Picchioni et al., 2014). In addition to being critical for patients to safely and humanely undergo traumatic surgical or diagnostic procedures, anesthesia has long been recognized as a tool for studying the neural mechanisms of loss and recovery of consciousness (Beecher, 1947). In 10 healthy volunteers, we used EEG recordings, and an auditory task to confirm that dexmedetomidine induced a loss of voluntary responsiveness, and exhibited a neurophysiological profile that was similar to non rapid eye movement (NREM) II sleep (Akeju et al., 2014). We then studied 18F-FDG uptake during baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness in these 10 healthy volunteers in a separate experiment where we defined loss of consciousness as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes (Figure 2A). During both the baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness 18F-FDG study visits (two per subject), fMRI data were also recorded. Consistent with a global decrease in glucose metabolism, we found that during the unconscious state, there was a broad reduction in 18F-FDG standardized uptake values in the brain (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). To quantify this result, we calculated CMRglc during the two 18F-FDG visits (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). We found reduced CMRglc in thalamic, frontal, and parietal brain regions during the unconscious state (Figure 2B, Table 1). The difference in CMRglc exhibited a spatial distribution consistent with the previously described DMN (Raichle et al., 2001; Damoiseaux et al., 2006) and both left and right FPNs (Table 1) (Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2008). We found these network-specific CMRglc changes interesting because the DMN has been linked to stimulus-independent thought and self-consciousness (Raichle et al., 2001; Mason et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008), while the FPNs have been linked to conscious perception of the external environment and executive control initiation (Boly et al., 2008; Vincent et al., 2008).10.7554/eLife.04499.004Figure 2.CMRglc and rCBF are decreased in both the default mode and the frontal-parietal network brain regions during unconsciousness.(A) Study outline of healthy volunteers recruited to undergo both baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness PET brain imaging in a random order.

Resting-state functional brain imaging is increasingly being utilized to probe the mechanisms of consciousness (Fox and Greicius, 2010). By using a very site-specific drug, performing for the first time simultaneous measurements of CMRglc, rCBF, resting state BOLD low frequency oscillations, and analyzing both dexmedetomidine-induced loss of consciousness and recovery, we have been able to identify a minimal disruption of neural networks that is shared between altered consciousness states. Our results show that during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, cortico-cortical functional connectivity remains intact but thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted. This disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity appropriately reverses during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. This study was conducted at the Athinoula A Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The Human Research Committee and the Radioactive Drug Research Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital approved the study protocol. After an initial email/phone screen, potential study subjects were invited to participate in a screening visit. At the screening visit, informed consent including the consent to publish was requested after the nature and possible consequences of the study was explained. All subjects provided informed consent and were American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status I with Mallampati Class I airway anatomy. After providing informed consent, a standard pre-anesthesia assessment was administered and a blood toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects were not taking drugs that might confound the interpretation of study results. A complete metabolic panel and a urine pregnancy test were also obtained to confirm that all values were within normal ranges and to confirm non-pregnant status, respectively. A total of 20 subjects participated in screening visits and 18 subjects were deemed eligible to participate in the study protocol. Two subjects were deemed ineligible after medical evaluation and one subject was lost to follow-up after providing informed consent. During all study visits, subjects were required to take nothing by mouth for at least 8 hr. A urine toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects had not taken drugs that might confound interpretation of the results. A pregnancy test was also administered (serum for PET visits, urine for fMRI only visits) for each female subject to confirm non-pregnant status.
Understanding the neural basis of consciousness is fundamental to neuroscience research. Disruptions in cortico-cortical connectivity have been suggested as a primary mechanism of unconsciousness. By using a novel combination of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and recovery using the α2-agonist dexmedetomidine. During unconsciousness, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and cerebral blood flow were preferentially decreased in the thalamus, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the bilateral Frontoparietal Networks (FPNs). Cortico-cortical functional connectivity within the DMN and FPNs was preserved. However, DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was disrupted. Recovery from this state was associated with sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow and restored DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. We report that loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is sufficient to produce unconsciousness.
Although we are all familiar with the experience of being conscious, explaining precisely what consciousness is and how it arises from activity in the brain remains extremely challenging. Indeed, explaining consciousness is so challenging that it is sometimes referred to as ‘the hard question’ of neuroscience.
