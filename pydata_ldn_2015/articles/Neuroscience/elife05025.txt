 The medial temporal lobes (MTL) are known to play a key role in the formation of lasting memories, but there has been considerable debate about whether their involvement in memory retrieval is stable over time. Some models have suggested that the hippocampal formation (HF) is critical for supporting new memories, but that, over time, memories can be supported by neocortical areas alone. In one account, the shift from hippocampal to cortical representation reflects a transfer of the memory trace through a time-dependent process known as systems consolidation (Squire, 1992; Alvarez and Squire, 1994). This type of transfer is thought to preserve the quality and contents of the memory, although older memories may generally be weaker. Other accounts, however, have argued that changes in hippocampal vs cortical involvement are accompanied by the transformation of episodic memories, which require the HF, into semantic memories, which lack episodic context information and can be supported by cortex alone (Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997; Winocur et al., 2010). Behavioral data are presented in Table 1. Item memory was evaluated by comparing discriminability for old vs new items in the item recognition test. Item memory was above chance for both immediate, t(27) = 22.16, p < 0.001, and delayed test, t(27) = 18.85, p < 0.001, and, not surprisingly, accuracy was higher for items tested immediately than after a delay, t(27) = 8.54, p < 0.001. This difference was observed for both recollection, t(27) = 9.51, p < 0.001, and familiarity, t(27) = 5.06, p < 0.001, contributions to item recognition. Context memory was evaluated by comparing discriminability of intact and recombined sentences in the associative recognition test. Participants successfully discriminated between intact and recombined sentences for both immediate, t(26) = 8.22, p < 0.001, and delayed test, t(26) = 8.17, p < 0.001, and again, associative recognition accuracy was higher for sentences tested immediately than after a delay, t(26) = 5.13, p < 0.001. Consistent with the idea that item recollection might involve the reactivation of associative information, associative recognition accuracy was higher for recognized items that were associated with a ‘remember’ response than for recognized items that were not, F(1, 26) = 14.20, p < 0.001. The difference in source accuracy did not interact with delay, F(1, 26) = 0.27, p = 0.61.10.7554/eLife.05025.004Table 1.Behavioral resultsDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05025.00410.7554/eLife.05025.005Table 1—source data 1.Behavioral data.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05025.005Item recognition‘R’ rate‘4’ or ‘5’ rated′RecollectionFamiliarityImmediate0.46 ± 0.220.40 ± 0.221.79 ± 0.430.44 ± 0.220.46 ± 0.18Delayed0.25 ± 0.190.43 ± 171.14 ± 0.320.22 ± 180.32 ± 0.13Novel0.04 ± 0.050.23 ± 0.09---Associative recognition‘intact’ rated′% correct for ‘R’ responses% correct for ‘4’ or ‘5’ responsesImmediate intact0.78 ± 0.131.34 ± 0.5973.5 ± 16.668.6 ± 14.8Delayed intact0.64 ± 0.170.59 ± 0.3865.1 ± 18.457.7 ± 11.4Immediate recombined0.34 ± 0.14---Delayed recombined0.43 ± 0.13---Note: Summary statistics for individual subjects are contained in Table 1—source data 1. The current study provided novel evidence that HF and parahippocampal areas play different roles in supporting memory over time. During item recollection, the involvement of cortical MTL areas was stable over time. Within the HF, however, there were different effects for anterior and posterior regions. Whereas posterior HF showed reduced recollection-related activity after a 1-day delay, recollection-related activity in anterior HF remained relatively stable. Furthermore, anterior HF activity patterns carried information about contexts associated with the items at study, and this pattern information was maintained over time in participants who successfully retained context associations. Below, we relate these findings to extant neurobiological models of memory and discuss the specific contributions of individual MTL regions. We conclude that models of memory must account for variability among MTL subregions with respect to their involvement in memory retrieval over time. Data were acquired from 30 young adults (15 female; ages 18-31 years). Data from one participant was excluded due to button box issues during the scan, and data from another participant was excluded due to head motion and poor performance. Of the remaining 28 participants, 9 were excluded from fMRI data analyses due to insufficient variability in memory performance (i.e., fewer than 9 recollection or familiarity trials). Thus, the fMRI analyses included 19 participants (9 female). Due to technical problems, one of these participants completed the item recognition but not associative recognition task. Participants reported that they were native English speakers, free of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and eligible for MRI. Participants reported sleeping, on average, 7.42 hr (range: 5-12 hr) between the first and second session.
The medial temporal lobes play an important role in episodic memory, but over time, hippocampal contributions to retrieval may be diminished. However, it is unclear whether such changes are related to the ability to retrieve contextual information, and whether they are common across all medial temporal regions. Here, we used functional neuroimaging to compare neural responses during immediate and delayed recognition. Results showed that recollection-related activity in the posterior hippocampus declined after a 1-day delay. In contrast, activity was relatively stable in the anterior hippocampus and in neocortical areas. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses also revealed that anterior hippocampal patterns contained information about context during item recognition, and after a delay, context coding in this region was related to successful retention of context information. Together, these findings suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus have different contributions to memory over time and that neurobiological models of memory must account for these differences.
In 1953, an American man called Henry Molaison underwent surgery to remove the medial temporal lobes of his brain in an effort to cure him of severe epilepsy. After the surgery, his epilepsy was indeed improved, but he was left without the ability to form new memories. His case is now seen as one of the first demonstrations of the medial temporal lobes being involved in memory.
