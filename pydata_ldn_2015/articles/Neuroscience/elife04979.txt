 Psychiatric disorders not only diminish life quality of affected individuals, but also pose a substantial issue in public health because of their high prevalence in modern society. Mutations in ‘risk genes’ enhance the probability to develop these disorders, pointing to a strong genetic component in the etiology of mental illnesses (Ross et al., 2006). More than two decades ago, DISC1 has been identified as a major genetic risk factor involved in psychiatric disorders (St Clair et al., 1990; Blackwood et al., 2001). The original discovery came from a Scottish family carrying a large c-terminal 1:11 translocation in the DISC1 gene downstream of exon eight, which results in a c-terminal truncation of DISC1 (St Clair et al., 1990). Family members who are affected by the mutation suffer from mental illness including major depression (10 cases), schizophrenia (7 cases) or bipolar disorder (1 case, St Clair et al., 1990). By comparison (48 cases), no major psychiatric disease was diagnosed in any of the relatives lacking DISC1 truncation. Thus, truncation of DISC1 constitutes one of the largest known risk factors for mental illness. To investigate the effect of truncated Disc1 on potential depression- or schizophrenia-like phenotypes of Disc1 mice we conducted a comprehensive analysis covering a wide spectrum of behavioural deficits characteristic for psychiatric syndromes (Figure 1, refer to Table 1 for a summary of values). We probed depression-related traits using highly validated tests for anhedonia (LeGates et al., 2012) and behavioural despair (Porsolt et al., 1977; Steru et al., 1985) in rodents. Disc1 mice showed no deficit in sucrose preference, which is used to quantify anhedonia (Figure 1A). However, in the TST and forced swim test, in which animals exhibit epochs of immobility that are thought to reflect states of behavioural despair intersected by periods of active escape, Disc1 mice showed longer periods of immobility (Figure 1B,C). Behavioural variability among individuals was high and therefore resulted in a moderately but significantly enhanced mean immobility by 35% in the TST and by 18% in the forced swim test of Disc1 mice (TST: p = 0.015, 22 Disc1 and 14 control mice; forced swimming: p = 0.049, 22 and 20 mice; Cohen's d of 0.82 and 0.65 corresponding to a strong and moderate effect size, respectively [Table 1]). Both genotypes reached similar movement speeds in the open field arena, indicating that high immobility in the behavioural despair tests cannot be caused by motor impairment (Figure 1D).10.7554/eLife.04979.003Figure 1.Disc1 mice show depression-related behavioural despair.(A) Disc1 mice show similar sucrose preference as controls (146 ± 7 vs 144 ± 15% sucrose intake, n = 10 each group).

Our results demonstrate that a mutation in a high risk gene for depression, the DISC1 truncation correlates with reduced synchrony of theta and low-gamma oscillations in the PrlC. Notably and in line with the intact working memory of Disc1 mice (Sigurdsson et al., 2010), phase-locking between hippocampal and prefrontal regions was unchanged. In contrast, our results suggest that reduced low-gamma synchrony in the PrlC may contribute to enhanced immobility of Disc1 mice, interpreted as depression-related behaviour (Porsolt et al., 1977; Steru et al., 1985), and the extent of synchrony reduction predicted the magnitude of the phenotype. The mean Disc1 phenotype differed mildly but significantly from controls which can be largely explained by the high inter-individual variability in behaviour. We identified impaired synaptic excitatory input and inhibitory output of PV-FS-INs in the Disc1 PrlC as a strong candidate mechanism underlying low-gamma defects. Thus, truncation of DISC1 in human patients may contribute to the development of depression by affecting anatomical and physiological properties of prefrontal PV-FS-INs. All animal experimentation was in agreement with national legislation (approved by the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg). During behavioural tests, adult Disc1 mice (Shen et al., 2008) (>5 weeks) were housed with 2-5 animals per cage. Animals were accustomed to handling in daily sessions for at least two days prior to experimentation. For TST, the tail of the mice was fixed with tape to a horizontal bar at ∼25 cm height. Movement was recorded with an IP camera. All mice were tested once. The forced swim test was performed in a 2 l glass beaker filled with 1 l tap water. Both tests lasted 6 min. For open field analysis, the mice were placed in a 30 × 30 cm arena and videotaped for 10 min. Two regions of interest of identical area (center, periphery) were defined. The percentage time spent in both regions and the total distance travelled were quantified. To test for anhedonia, mice were housed individually with two drinking bottles per cage, one containing 1% sucrose solution, the other tap water. Liquid consumption from both bottles was measured after 48 hr. Prior to this test, mice were kept on a two-bottle paradigm for 2-5 days. The position of the sucrose containing flask was chosen randomly for each cage. Spatial reference and spatial working memory were tested in a radial 6-arm water maze in a bathing pool (120 cm diameter). The water (19-21°C) was whitened with non-toxic tempera colour. Mice were released from a random start arm and allowed to find the hidden platform within 1.5 min. After this time window mice were guided to the platform by the experimenter. Animals were allowed to rest on the platform for 15 s. Four runs per day were performed for 5 days with fixed target and random starting arm locations. After the last run a probe trial was conducted with the platform removed from the maze. Arm entry detection and tracking of movement was performed automatically with custom-made ImageJ routines based on MTrack2 and Python routines. Spatial reference memory errors were defined as entries in non-target arms and spatial working memory errors as re-entries in previously explored non-target arms within a trial. A match-to-place task was performed in a 3-arm water maze with a start arm, a target arm with hidden platform, and a non-target arm. Each mouse first underwent a 30 s extinction trial with only start arm and non-target arm open. After a 30 s inter-trial interval, the mouse was put back in the start arm, this time with both arms accessible (sample trial). Animals were allowed to find the platform within 1.5 min and were guided to the platform in case they failed to perform the task. Mice rested on the platform for 15 s upon arrival. Finally, after another 30 s inter-trial interval, the match trial task was conducted similarly to the sample trial. A trial was defined as correct if the mouse first entered the target arm in the match trial (3 runs per day for 4 days). The extradimensional paradigm-shifting test was carried out in a Y-maze. Mice were food-restricted for 5 days. During this time, they were trained to search for food reward available at the end of both target arms upon release from the start arm. From day 6 onward, mice received food reward in the right arm (‘right correct’ task). During all tasks, both target arms were randomly illuminated with LEDs. When mice reached the learning criterion (10 subsequent correct runs or 1 error in 12 runs), the reward rule was switched to ‘light on—correct arm’. Learning was measured in 10 subsequent runs and from learning curves computed with the Learning Analysis toolbox (Smith et al., 2004). Social behaviour was measured in a 3-chamber social interaction arena composed of two side chambers and one central chamber (30 × 19 cm each). Both side chambers contained a wire pencil cup. In the first habituation run, mice explore the arena. In the second run, a stranger mouse was placed in one randomly chosen cup (individual run duration 10 min). The total travel distance and time spent in each compartment were quantified. For all tests, animals were randomly chosen and test apparatuses, except the water maze, were cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals.
Rhythmic neuronal activity provides a frame for information coding by co-active cell assemblies. Abnormal brain rhythms are considered as potential pathophysiological mechanisms causing mental disease, but the underlying network defects are largely unknown. We find that mice expressing truncated Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (Disc1), which mirror a high-prevalence genotype for human psychiatric illness, show depression-related behavior. Theta and low-gamma synchrony in the prelimbic cortex (PrlC) is impaired in Disc1 mice and inversely correlated with the extent of behavioural despair. While weak theta activity is driven by the hippocampus, disturbance of low-gamma oscillations is caused by local defects of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs). The number of FS-INs is reduced, they receive fewer excitatory inputs, and form fewer release sites on targets. Computational analysis indicates that weak excitatory input and inhibitory output of FS-INs may lead to impaired gamma oscillations. Our data link network defects with a gene mutation underlying depression in humans.
Our thoughts and emotions are produced and processed by complex networks of neurons inside our brains. Signals are sent from one neuron to another via chemical messengers, and pass through the neuron as an electrical signal. The electrical signals produced by a brain region often show steady rhythms, or oscillations. In the brains of many people diagnosed with certain mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression, these oscillations are disrupted, but how these changes in rhythm are linked to defects in the networks of neurons behind the electrical activity is not well understood.
