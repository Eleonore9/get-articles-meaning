 Visually guided behavior is widespread in animals (Ullén et al., 1997; Garm et al., 2007; Orger et al., 2008; Burgess et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013), yet the underlying neuronal circuits and their evolutionary origins remain poorly understood. Spatial vision requires at least two photoreceptors and a neural circuitry capable of making a comparison between the photoreceptor inputs without body movement (Land and Nilsson, 2002; Nilsson, 2009). The spatial information obtained must then translate to a coordinated motor output. To reconstruct the full chemical synaptic connectivity map of the visual eyes in the Platynereis larva we used ssTEM. Following high-pressure freezing and cryosubstitution, we collected 1690 thin sections (40-50 nm) from a single Epon-embedded 3-day-old larva, encompassing the entire head and part of the first trunk segment. Following contrasting, we imaged the sections at 3.7 nm/pixel resolution, in a 140 µm × 140 µm × 80 µm volume (Figure 1A-C; Video 1).10.7554/eLife.02730.003Figure 1.Serial-section electron microscopy imaging of the visual eye circuit in a Platynereis larva.(A) Scanning electron micrograph of a 72 hr-post-fertilization larva, dorsal view.

Grid spacing is 10 μm.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02730.013 Here we described the neural connectome of the visual system in the Platynereis larva. The four eyes mediate visual phototaxis, during which larvae are able to detect and contrast spatial differences in the light field. Although it is not yet possible to directly link all neurons and connections in the Platynereis larva to phototactic behavior, the combined analysis of connectivity and behavior yielded fundamental insights into a visually guided behavior. Platynereis larvae were obtained from an in-house breeding culture following an established protocol (Hauenschild and Fischer, 1969). Larvae were kept at 18°C for development. Behavioral experiments were performed at room temperature.
Animals use spatial differences in environmental light levels for visual navigation; however, how light inputs are translated into coordinated motor outputs remains poorly understood. Here we reconstruct the neuronal connectome of a four-eye visual circuit in the larva of the annelid Platynereis using serial-section transmission electron microscopy. In this 71-neuron circuit, photoreceptors connect via three layers of interneurons to motorneurons, which innervate trunk muscles. By combining eye ablations with behavioral experiments, we show that the circuit compares light on either side of the body and stimulates body bending upon left-right light imbalance during visual phototaxis. We also identified an interneuron motif that enhances sensitivity to different light intensity contrasts. The Platynereis eye circuit has the hallmarks of a visual system, including spatial light detection and contrast modulation, illustrating how image-forming eyes may have evolved via intermediate stages contrasting only a light and a dark field during a simple visual task.
Many animals show automatic responses to light, from moths, which are attracted to light sources, to cockroaches, which are repelled by them. This phenomenon, known as phototaxis, is thought to help animals navigate through their environment. It is an evolutionarily ancient behavior, as revealed by its widespread presence in the animal kingdom. One animal with a simple visual system for phototactic behavior is the marine worm Platynereis dumerilii.
