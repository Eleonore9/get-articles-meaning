 Several neuropathies, lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative disorders primarily affect the nervous system, despite underlying defects in cellular processes that occur in all cells (Schultz et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) is a sensory neuropathy that primarily affects some of the longest axon projections in the human body and is caused by mutations in the rab7 locus. rab7 encodes a GTPase that regulates endolysosomal degradation in all cells (Elliott et al., 1997). All known mutations in CMT2B patients alter highly conserved amino acids in Rab7 and cause pathology in heterozygosity (Kwon et al., 1995; Verhoeven et al., 2003; Houlden et al., 2004; Meggouh et al., 2006). Hence, CMT2B is a genetically dominant disease. Our recent functional profiling of all rab GTPases in Drosophila suggested an increased neuronal demand for rab7 function compared to other cell types based on elevated neuronal expression of rab7, but not rab5 or rab11 (Chan et al., 2011). To investigate an enhanced or specialized role for rab7 in the nervous system, we generated a null mutant by replacing the rab7 open reading frame with a Gal4 knock-in cassette (Figure 1A); the Gal4 knock-in provides a means to express any gene of interest under the endogenous regulatory elements of rab7 in either heterozygous or homozygous rab7 mutants (Brand and Perrimon, 1993; Chan et al., 2011, 2012). Loss of rab7 leads to lethality between 50-80% of pupal development (P+50%-P+80%) with no gross morphological abnormalities. Loss of the maternal contribution causes lethality in fully developed embryos with no obvious developmental defects. Wholemount preparations of the brain in null mutant pupae at P+35% reveal a loss of Rab7 immunolabeling to background levels (Figure 1B,C) (Chinchore et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2011). By P+50% substantial accumulations of the endosomal marker Hrs become apparent, although the overall brain structure appears normal (Figure 1D,E). In addition, immunolabeling of photoreceptor axons indicates that cell-type specification and axon pathfinding are normal, but the photoreceptor membrane protein Chaoptin (24B10) accumulates in the brain (Figure 1F,G). Overexpressing UAS-YFP-Rab7 under control of the rab7Gal4-knock-in in the homozygous mutant rescues these phenotypes (Figure 1F-H).10.7554/eLife.01064.003Figure 1.Loss of rab7 in neurons causes adult-onset degeneration that begins with a loss of synaptic function.(A) Knock-out strategy: replacement of the complete rab7 open reading frame with a Gal4 knock-in cassette (Chan et al., 2011, 2012).

Our results show that loss of rab7 function causes progressive and usage-dependent loss of synaptic function and neurodegeneration without affecting neuronal development or other tissues. This loss-of-function phenotype is dosage-dependent. In contrast, overexpression of the CMT2B mutant variants of rab7 causes no neuropathy-like phenotypes, even at high levels. We conclude that the four CMT2B mutants are hypomorphic alleles of rab7 that retain 5-50% of wild-type function (Figure 8A,B). We therefore propose that CMT2B is a dominant neuropathy due to partial loss-of-function. This reinterpretation of CMT2B has the significant consequence that a potential therapy may involve increasing the mutant protein function, which is opposite to the current proposal to reduce the mutant protein function.10.7554/eLife.01064.023Figure 8.Summary of rab7 allele function and partial loss-of-function model.(A) The seven rab7 alleles analyzed here form an allelic series based on endosome recruitment and Rab5/Hrs colocalization in motor neurons and photoreceptor sensory neurons. First row summarizes data in Figure 2J; second row summarize data in Figure 2H; third row summarizes data in Figure 5G,H and the fourth row summarizes data in Figure 3B,D. Note that only the constitutively active Rab7-Q67L exhibits clearly reduced fitness at higher expression levels, but none of the CMT2B mutants (Figure 4A). (B) The allelic series is characterized by a gradual loss of the ability of Rab7 to be recruited to endosomal compartments. In contrast, conversion of Rab7-positive compartments is normal. (C) Partial loss-of-function model. A few day-old flies exhibit neuropathy-like phenotypes at 50% rab7 function, which can be rescued by mildly increasing rab7 function by expressing partial loss-of-function alleles. Humans exhibit neuropathy symptoms only after ≥12 years at levels that are, based on our analysis of the CMT2B alleles plus one wild type copy, between 60% and 90% of total rab7 function.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01064.023 The generation of rab7 targeting vector by recombineering was performed as previously described (Chan et al., 2011, 2012) with some modifications. We generated a new genomic fragment containing the rab7 locus with asymmetric flanking homology arms of 10 kb at 5′ and 5 kb at 3′. The final targeting vector was injected into PBac{y[+]-attP-3B}VK00033 landing site by Rainbow Transgenic Services (CA, USA) using PhiC31-mediated integration.
The small GTPase Rab7 is a key regulator of endosomal maturation in eukaryotic cells. Mutations in rab7 are thought to cause the dominant neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) by a gain-of-function mechanism. Here we show that loss of rab7, but not overexpression of rab7 CMT2B mutants, causes adult-onset neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model. All CMT2B mutant proteins retain 10-50% function based on quantitative imaging, electrophysiology, and rescue experiments in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Consequently, expression of CMT2B mutants at levels between 0.5 and 10-fold their endogenous levels fully rescues the neuropathy-like phenotypes of the rab7 mutant. Live imaging reveals that CMT2B proteins are inefficiently recruited to endosomes, but do not impair endosomal maturation. These findings are not consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Instead, they indicate a dosage-dependent sensitivity of neurons to rab7-dependent degradation. Our results suggest a therapeutic approach opposite to the currently proposed reduction of mutant protein function.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited disorder of the nervous system with symptoms that typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood. The sensory and motor nerves gradually degenerate, causing muscles to waste away and leading to the loss of touch sensation across the body. One subtype of the disease—Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B—is caused by mutations in a gene called rab7, which codes for a protein that helps to regulate the breakdown of waste proteins inside cells.
