 An essential capacity of the brain is to form internal representations of the external world. Whereas representations of past experiences can be stored internally and be rapidly recalled from memory, neuronal representations of novel experiences develop from the interaction between specific external stimuli and the spontaneous internal neuronal dynamics during the novel experience. During the free exploration of spatial environments, individual hippocampal neurons fire at specific spatial locations of the animal and are activated sequentially along the trajectory of the animal (place cells) (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978; McNaughton et al., 1983; O’Keefe and Recce, 1993; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993; Lee and Wilson, 2002). Sequences of place cells with partially overlapping fields fire with compressed temporal delays that correspond to the Euclidian distance between the location of their place field peaks (Muller et al., 1996; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006). This phenomenon, known as sequence compression (Skaggs et al., 1996; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006) is thought to be an animal model of the internal representation of an external space by the place cell assemblies in the CA1 area of the rodent hippocampus (Skaggs et al., 1996; Dragoi et al., 2003; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006; O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978). Ensemble neuronal recordings were performed from the CA1 area of the hippocampus in CT and CA3 NMDAR KO mice alternating between periods of sleep/rest in the sleep/rest box and periods of exploration of portions of walled linear and L-shaped tracks under three conditions of behavioral novelty (Figure 1A). Under the de novo condition, naïve mice previously housed in small cages slept in the sleep/rest box (pre-DnRun1 sleep/rest), after which they were allowed to explore a linear track for the first time (i.e., novel track) for two run sessions (DnRun1 and DnRun2) separated by sleep/rest epochs in the sleep/rest box (Figure 1A, Table 1; ‘Materials and methods’). The sleep/rest session between DnRun1 and DnRun2 is referred to as post-DnRun1 when correlated with DnRun1 and pre-DnRun2 when correlated with DnRun2, while the one following DnRun2 is referred to as post-DnRun2. After the sessions under the de novo condition, the majority of mice were transferred to home cages for one night and returned to the sleep/rest box for the recording session of the next day. This session is referred to as pre-ContigRun session because it preceded a run session under the contiguous condition.10.7554/eLife.01326.003Figure 1.Experimental design and place cell dynamics across experimental conditions and sessions.(A) Experimental design displaying sleep/rest - run - sleep/rest sessions across de novo, contiguous, and disjunct experimental conditions.

Paired columns represent successive experimental sessions within the same condition and day (de novo, B; contiguous, C; disjunct, D). Colorbars refer to all corresponding sessions, except for those where numbers at the top of the place field maps reflect corresponding peak firing rates.

Stability of the place cell map was calculated as the correlation between place fields at the beginning (first four laps of run) vs the end (last four laps) of the Run sessions. For the contiguous condition ContigRun session, only the place cells active on the novel arm were included. Error bars represent SEM. Stars mark significant differences.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01326.00310.7554/eLife.01326.004Figure 1—figure supplement 1.Stereotypy of the mouse behavior (velocity and distance travelled) during the first four and the last four laps of run during different experimental conditions and sessions and across genotypes.(A) Average velocity of animal movement. (B) Averages of total distance travelled per lap. Error bars represent SEM. Stars mark significant differences. The difference between the distance travelled during the first and the last four laps during ContigRun reflect the fact that initially the mice explored more the novel arm, while later they ran more between the familiar and the novel arm.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01326.00410.7554/eLife.01326.005Table 1.The order and duration of the recording sessionsDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01326.005Floxed CT miceDe novo condition, duration (min)Contiguous condition, duration (min)Disjunct condition, duration (min)Mouse #Pre-DNRun1 sleep/restDnRun1Post-DnRun1 sleep/restDnRun2Post-DnRun2 sleep/restIntervalfRunPre-ContgRun sleep/restFamRun1ContigRunPost-ContgRun sleep/restIntervalFamRun2Pre-DisjRun1 sleep/restDisjRun1Post-DisjRun1 sleep/restDisjRun2CT12760852134∼24 hr-30263691CT25554696030--69603456∼48 hr2996314315CT35244603163--63313487∼48 hr2256194815CT47837311660∼24 hr2962154281∼48 hr2550152516CA3 NR1 KO miceDe novo condition, duration (min)Contiguous condition, duration (min)Disjunct condition, duration (min)Mouse #Pre-DNRun1 sleep/restDnRun1Post-DnRun1 sleep/restDnRun2Post-DnRun2 sleep/restDnRun3Post-DnRun3 sleep/restIntervalfRunPre-ContgRun sleep/restFamRun1ContigRunPost-ContgRun sleep/restIntervalFamRun2Pre-DisjRun1 sleep/restDisjRun1Post-DisjRun1 sleep/restDisjRun2KO1242536212724117∼24 hr2514103583∼48 hr2253152516KO255384846602932∼24 hr-30305162KO35948543530----30364448∼48 hr4769387021KO410450321728--∼24 hr3623104035∼48 hr3630203520 Previous studies on spatial representation in the hippocampus either investigated the process of spatial encoding by evaluating the dynamics of place field formation and neuronal correlation during exploration (Hill, 1978; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993; Nakazawa et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2004; Cacucci et al., 2007; Brun et al., 2008) or, separately, described the phenomenon of temporal sequence replay during awake resting (Foster and Wilson, 2006; Diba and Buzsaki, 2007; Davidson et al., 2009; Karlsson and Frank, 2009) or post-Run sleep (Nadasdy et al., 1999; Lee and Wilson, 2002; Ji and Wilson, 2007; Karlsson and Frank, 2009). Importantly, all of these studies used experienced animals which were either pre-trained on similar environments or were simply re-exposed to the familiar ones, and whose prior neuronal activity as naïve animals in previous environments was not documented. Overall, the expression of spatially tuned novel place fields in experienced animals as reported in some of the previous studies (Hill, 1978; Nakazawa et al., 2003) is consistent with our findings in experienced CT mice (contiguous and disjunct conditions), though a faster timescale analysis might reveal additional dynamics in spatial tuning (Frank et al., 2004). A total of 20 adult male mice with ages between 18-22 weeks were employed in this study. Half of them (n = 10) had the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 deleted specifically in the CA3 area of the hippocampus (Nakazawa et al., 2002) leading to a complete loss of NMDA receptors in the CA3 pyramidal cells (the KO group). The other half (the CT group) was represented by the floxed-NR1 mice (Tsien et al., 1996). The CT mice were littermates of the CA3 NMDAR KO mice; both CT and KO mice had been back-crossed to C57BL/6 mice. The knock-out of the NR1 subunit was achieved using the Cre/loxP recombination system (Tsien et al., 1996) and was present in homozygous floxed, Cre-positive mice starting with the age of 15 weeks (Nakazawa et al., 2002).
Prior experience accelerates acquisition of novel, related information through processes like assimilation into mental schemas, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the roles that prior experience and hippocampal CA3 N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity play in CA1 place cell sequence encoding and learning during novel spatial experiences. We found that specific representations of de novo experiences on linear environments were formed on a framework of pre configured network activity expressed in the preceding sleep and were rapidly, flexibly adjusted via NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience accelerated encoding of subsequent experiences on contiguous or isolated novel tracks, significantly decreasing their NMDAR-dependence. Similarly, de novo learning of an alternation task was facilitated by CA3 NMDARs; this experience accelerated subsequent learning of related tasks, independent of CA3 NMDARs, consistent with a schema-based learning. These results reveal the existence of distinct neuronal encoding schemes which could explain why hippocampal dysfunction results in anterograde amnesia while sparing recollection of old, schema-based memories.
Learning is an inherent feature of the living animals. During development and childhood we learn a large repertoire of items that we encounter for the first time in our life, such as the names of things and how to perform certain tasks. This de novo learning process takes a relatively long time and generally requires repeated exposures to the particular features of the external world that are being learned. Later in life, when we are exposed to novel but related features, we acquire this new information much faster. For instance, if a child learns to associate various odors with various locations around the home—such as associating the smell of bread with the kitchen and the smell air freshener with the bathroom—they will find it easier to make new odor-place associations outside the home, such as associating gasoline with gas stations.
