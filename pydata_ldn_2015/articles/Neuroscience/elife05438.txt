 Neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors are essential for brain development and synaptic plasticity (McAllister et al., 1996; Huang and Reichardt, 2001; Poo, 2001; Samson and Medcalf, 2006; van den Pol, 2012). These neuromodulators are transported in dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Dysregulation of DCV transport and fusion is associated with cognitive and post-traumatic stress disorders (Sadakata et al., 2007b; Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011; Sah and Geracioti, 2013). DCVs bud off at the Golgi network (Kim et al., 2006) and are transported via microtubule-based motor proteins (Hirokawa et al., 2009; Schlager and Hoogenraad, 2009). High-frequency firing facilitates DCV fusion and the resultant calcium influx triggers SNARE complex-dependent DCV secretion (Bartfai et al., 1988; Hartmann et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2009; van de Bospoort et al., 2012). Unlike synaptic vesicles (SVs), DCVs lack a local recycling mechanism. To ensure a constant and uniform supply of DCVs at release sites, DCVs are generally very dynamic although some DCVs are stationary. Stimulation triggers arrest of moving DCVs (de Wit et al., 2006; Shakiryanova et al., 2006; Matsuda et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2012), probably promoting their local availability for secretion. DCV fusion sites can be located in the entire neuron but DCVs preferentially fuse at presynaptic terminals and release at extra-synaptic sites requires more robust stimulation (van de Bospoort et al., 2012). Recently, we have shown that Munc13 is an important regulator of DCV fusion at synapses (van de Bospoort et al., 2012). However, in contrast to SV release, a comprehensive insight in the molecular mechanisms of DCV secretion is still lacking. To understand CAPS-1 function in neuronal DCV release, we first investigated its sub-cellular localization in cultured neurons. Hippocampal neurons at 14 days in vitro (DIV 14) were stained with a novel, CAPS-1-specific antibody (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). CAPS-1 was present in the cytosol and in dendritic and axonal puncta, probably membrane domains (Figure 1A). Approximately 45% of these CAPS-1 puncta co-localized with the synaptic marker VGLUT1 in the entire neuron (Figure 1B, C, Pearson's coefficient: 0.42plus-minus0.04, n=7). CAPS-1 immunoreactivity was detectable in approximately 60% of VGLUT1 positive synapses and vice versa approximately 60% of the CAPS-1 puncta co-localized with VGLUT1 (Figure 1B, D, Manders' coefficients CAPS-1 in VGLUT1: 0.67plus-minus0.08, and VGLUT1 in CAPS-1: 0.64plus-minus0.05, n=8). CAPS-1 domains were also found at extra-synaptic sites (Figure 1B, E, white arrowheads). The CAPS-1 expression pattern differed from the sub-cellular localization of the DCV priming protein Munc13-1, which was much more restricted to the synapse (Figure 1E, F, Pearson's coefficient in the entire neuron: 0.64plus-minus0.04, n=10) with 96% of synapses containing M13-1 (Figure 1G, number of synapses containing M13-1: 96.3plus-minus0.7%, n=4, number of synapses containing CAPS-1: 58.1plus-minus10.9%, n=7). Since CAPS proteins have been initially identified as DCV resident proteins (Berwin et al., 1998), we tested the co-localization of CAPS-1 with DCVs in hippocampal neurons. Using the endogenous DCV protein chromogranin B (ChrB) we found that the majority of DCVs are located in the axon (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Antibody incompatibility precluded co-staining of CAPS-1 antibody with antibodies against ChrB. Therefore, we used the DCV cargo neuropeptide Y (NPY) fused to Venus (Nagai et al., 2002), which showed more than 80% co-localization with this endogenous marker (Figure 1H, I, Manders' coefficients for chromogranin B in NPY-Venus puncta: 0.97plus-minus0.02, and NPY-Venus in ChrB puncta: 0.84plus-minus0.01, n=14). Approximately 35% of NPY-Venus labeled DCVs co-localized with endogenous CAPS-1 (Figure 1J–L, Pearson's coefficient: 0.45plus-minus0.05, n=21, number of NPY-labeled DCVs co-expressing CAPS-1: 34.71plus-minus3.03%, n=6). These data show that endogenous CAPS-1 is present at many but not all synapses. In addition, CAPS-1 domains are found at extra-synaptic regions and CAPS-1 partly co-localizes with DCV markers.10.7554/eLife.05438.003Figure 1.CAPS-1 clusters are present at synaptic and extra-synaptic sites and partly co-localize with DCVs.(A) Example image of a hippocampal neuron (DIV 14) stained for endogenous CAPS-1 (green), dendrite marker MAP2 (blue) and synapse marker VGLUT1 (red).

CAPS-1 is present at synapses and co-localizes with DCV markers but rarely travels together with dynamic DCVs. Using two DCV secretion assays we found that CAPS-1 deletion strongly impaired synaptic and extra-synaptic DCV release in hippocampal neurons. CAPS-1 deletion did not reduce the presence or docking of DCVs at synaptic sites, but strongly affected DCV secretion of stationary DCVs. Synaptic expression levels of CAPS-1 were modulated by neuronal activity and correlated with DCV release probability. CAPS-1 thus functions as a priming protein at synaptic and extra-synaptic sites, promoting the fusion competence of stationary DCVs. SemapHluorin was generated by replacing EGFP in Sema3A-EGFP (De Wit et al., 2005) with super-ecliptic pHluorin (SpH) (de Wit et al., 2009). NPY-Venus was previously described (Nagai et al., 2002) and NPY-SpH was generated by replacing Venus with SpH (de Wit et al., 2009). Synapsin-mCherry was a kind gift of Dr A Jeromin (Allen Brain Institute, Seattle, USA) and synapsin-ECFP was obtained by replacing mCherry with ECFP. CAPS-1 (KIAA1121-Kazusa DNA) was sequence verified and cloned as CAPS-1-ires-EGFP and EYFP-CAPS-1. All constructs but SemapHluorin were subcloned into pLenti vectors that were produced as described (Naldini et al., 1996). Transduction efficiencies were tested on HEK cells.
Neuropeptides released from dense-core vesicles (DCVs) modulate neuronal activity, but the molecules driving DCV secretion in mammalian neurons are largely unknown. We studied the role of calcium-activator protein for secretion (CAPS) proteins in neuronal DCV secretion at single vesicle resolution. Endogenous CAPS-1 co-localized with synaptic markers but was not enriched at every synapse. Deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 did not affect DCV biogenesis, loading, transport or docking, but DCV secretion was reduced by 70% in CAPS-1/CAPS-2 double null mutant (DKO) neurons and remaining fusion events required prolonged stimulation. CAPS deletion specifically reduced secretion of stationary DCVs. CAPS-1-EYFP expression in DKO neurons restored DCV secretion, but CAPS-1-EYFP and DCVs rarely traveled together. Synaptic localization of CAPS-1-EYFP in DKO neurons was calcium dependent and DCV fusion probability correlated with synaptic CAPS-1-EYFP expression. These data indicate that CAPS-1 promotes fusion competence of immobile (tethered) DCVs in presynaptic terminals and that CAPS-1 localization to DCVs is probably not essential for this role.
Our ability to think and act is due to the remarkable capacity of the brain to process complex information. This involves nerve cells (or neurons) communicating with each other in a rapid and precise manner by releasing synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters across the gaps—called synapses—between neurons. In addition to this fast neurotransmitter signalling, neurons can transmit signals by releasing chemical signals called neuropeptides. Neuropeptides are major regulators of human brain function, including mood, anxiety, and social interactions.
