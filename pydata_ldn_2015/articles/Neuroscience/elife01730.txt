 Although lifespan is well studied in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (Kenyon, 2010), the aging process per se is still under intense research (Jin, 2010). For example, behavioral and/or mental ability starts to decline during early aging, prior to any dramatic structural or morphological dysfunction (Salthouse, 2004; Guo et al., 2012). The decline could be due to physiological alterations toward a non-optimal state, which leads to the failure of proper behavioral execution. Therefore, it is urgent to uncover the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the physiological changes, so that certain actions could prevent or postpone the non-optimal modifications that occur during aging. Previously, we reported that C. elegans male mating behavior deteriorates during early aging. N2 and him-5(e1490) C. elegans (henceforth, will be referred to as wild type) males’ mating capability begins to decline at day 3 of their adulthood, although their median lifespan is 11-12 days (Guo et al., 2012). We demonstrated that transient starvation of young males can extend their mating span, partially through up-regulation of ether-a-go-go K+ channels (LeBoeuf et al., 2011); however, our data also suggested that transient starvation can improve mating through additional mechanisms (Guo et al., 2012). Considering that metabolism is altered in food-deprived males (Tan et al., 2011), we tested whether perturbing the histone deacetylase metabolic regulator, sir-2.1, affects the functional span of copulation behavior in fed and transiently starved/re-fed males. Behavioral decline at advanced age can be attributed to morphological degeneration, such as neuronal death and muscle sarcopenia (Herndon et al., 2002; Glenn et al., 2004). However, during early aging, prior to any significant cellular decay, physiological changes that affect neuronal and muscular functionality can contribute to the reduction of behavioral coordination (Salthouse, 2004). Male mating in C. elegans is a complex behavior that requires coordination of multiple motor systems to impregnate the hermaphrodite (Liu et al., 2011; Correa et al., 2012). Previously, we showed that male mating behavior declines significantly during early aging. Wild type cannot mate well at adulthood day 3, and this decline is correlated with an increased excitability in the sex circuitry (Guo et al., 2012). Similar to aging males, a recent study using hermaphrodites showed that synaptic transmission in the locomotion circuit is enhanced after 5 days of adulthood (Mulcahy et al., 2013). Thus, it is possible that during early aging, the neuromuscular systems of both sexes become hyperexcitable. However, the faster decline in mating suggests that the male reproductive circuitry is more sensitive to age-related physiological changes. Worms were grown at 20°C on nematode growth media (NGM) plates seeded with E. coli strain OP50, except for strains containing the pha-1(e2123), which were maintained at 15°C. The alleles used in this work included: lite-1(ce314) on LGX; pck-2(ok2586) on LGI; pck-1(ok2098), pha-1(e2123) (Schnabel and Schnabel, 1990), unc-64(e240) (Brenner, 1974) on LGIII; sir-2.1(ok434) on LGIV; and him-5(e1490) (Hodgkin et al., 1979) on LGV. The males were generated by the him-5(e1490) mutation. Males containing only this mutation are referred to as wild-type; him-5(e1490) males have been shown to mate efficiently as wild type (Hodgkin, 1983). pck-2(ok2586), pck-1(ok2098), and sir-2.1(ok434) were generated by the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium. sir-2.1(ok434) animals were out-crossed 4 times with the him-5(e1490) strain. The deletion in sir-2.1(0) was detected through PCR using primers listed in the Supplementary file 2.
The decline of aging C. elegans male’s mating behavior is correlated with the increased excitability of the cholinergic circuitry that executes copulation. In this study, we show that the mating circuits’ functional durability depends on the metabolic regulator SIR-2.1, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase. Aging sir-2.1(0) males display accelerated mating behavior decline due to premature hyperexcitability of cholinergic circuits used for intromission and ejaculation. In sir-2.1(0) males, the hypercontraction of the spicule-associated muscles pinch the vas deferens opening, thus blocking sperm release. The hyperexcitability is aggravated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral analyses suggest that in sir-2.1(0) and older wild-type males, enhanced catabolic enzymes expression, coupled with the reduced expression of ROS-scavengers contribute to the behavioral decline. However, as a compensatory response to reduce altered catabolism/ROS production, anabolic enzymes expression levels are also increased, resulting in higher gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis.
Although the signs of aging are clear to us all, precisely why we age is less well understood. One possibility is that as cells use oxygen to fuel the breakdown of large molecules into smaller ones to release energy, they also generate by-products called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA. As we get older, this damage gets worse. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that a reduced calorie intake can reduce oxidative damage in certain species, in addition to extending lifespan.
