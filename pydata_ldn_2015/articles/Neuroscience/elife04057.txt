 Calcium plays a key role in the control of transmitter release at chemical synapses (Neher, 1998; Südhof, 2013). As transmitter release is a Ca2+-dependent biochemical process, one would expect that both the extent and kinetics of release will depend on Ca2+ concentration. In contrast to this expectation, the time course of release (TCR) at the neuromuscular junction is independent of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) (Datyner and Gage, 1980; Van der Kloot, 1988; Parnas et al., 1989). However, the apparent [Ca2+]o independence of the TCR is less well established at central synapses (Sargent et al., 2005). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Several potential explanations were proposed, including adaptation of transmitter release (Hsu et al., 1996) and additional voltage sensors that control the timing of release (Parnas et al., 2000; See; Felmy et al., 2003). Recent results suggested that in several central synapses presynaptic Ca2+ channels and release sensors are tightly coupled (Bucurenciu et al., 2008; Eggermann et al., 2012; Scimemi and Diamond, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2013). Tight coupling might be another factor contributing to the apparent [Ca2+]o independence of the TCR (Yamada and Zucker, 1992). However, this possibility has not been directly examined. We studied the [Ca2+]o dependence of transmitter release at GABAergic synapses between cerebellar basket cells (BCs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), using paired whole-cell recordings from synaptically connected neurons in mouse brain slices (Caillard et al., 2000; Sakaba, 2008; Eggermann and Jonas, 2012; Figure 1A-D). Action potentials were evoked in the presynaptic BC in whole-cell current-clamp or cell-attached voltage-clamp configurations, whereas IPSCs were recorded in the postsynaptic PC under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions (series resistance 3.8 ± 0.1 MΩ; mean ± SEM; 92 cells; ‘Materials and methods’). Unitary IPSCs were initiated with short latency and high temporal precision. Synaptic latency was 1.20 ± 0.03 ms at ∼22°C (24 pairs) and 0.47 ± 0.02 ms at ∼34°C (5 pairs; Figure 1C,D). Synaptic transmission was entirely blocked by bath application of the selective P/Q-type Ca2+ channel blocker ω-agatoxin IVa (1 µM), whereas the N-type Ca2+ channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIa (1 µM) had no detectable effect (Figure 1E-H). Thus, transmitter release at this synapse is selectively mediated by P/Q-type Ca2+ channels.10.7554/eLife.04057.003Figure 1.Fast and synchronous transmitter release at BC-PC synapses in the cerebellum is exclusively mediated by P/Q-type Ca2+ channels.(A) Light micrograph of a cerebellar basket cell filled with biocytin during recording and labeled using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Similar morphological properties were obtained in 29 other biocytin-labeled cerebellar BCs. (B) Plot of IPSC peak amplitude (top) and corresponding series resistance (bottom) against time during recording. Action potentials were evoked in the presynaptic cell at time intervals of 4 s. Note that evoked IPSC shows only little rundown for more than 40 min with stable series resistance.

To achieve maximal stability, presynaptic BCs were noninvasively stimulated in the cell-attached configuration in all experiments. * and ** indicate p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. All experiments except subsets in (C), (D) were performed at ∼22°C.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04057.003 Our results address a long-standing question in the field of synaptic transmission (Yamada and Zucker, 1992; Parnas et al., 2000): If release probability is highly dependent on extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967), how is it possible that the timing of release is [Ca2+]o-independent (Datyner and Gage, 1980; Van der Kloot, 1988; Parnas et al., 1989)? Slices were cut from the cerebellum of 14- to 16-day-old C57/Bl6 wild-type mice of either sex. Experiments were performed in strict accordance with institutional, national, and European guidelines for animal experimentation. Mice were maintained under light (7 am-7 pm) and dark cycle (7 pm-7 am) conditions and were kept in a litter of 8 animals together with the mother in a single cage. Animals were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane (Forane, AbbVie, Austria) and sacrificed by rapid decapitation. The brain was rapidly dissected out and immersed in ice-cold slicing solution containing 87 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM D-glucose, 75 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 7 mM MgCl2, (pH 7.4 in 95% O2 / 5% CO2, ∼326 mOsm). Parasagittal 250-µm-thick cerebellar slices from the vermis region were cut using a custom-built vibratome. After ∼20 min incubation at ∼35°C, the slices were stored at room temperature. Experiments were performed at 21-23°C, unless specified differently, or at either 11-13°C or 32-35°C in subsets of experiments as indicated.
A puzzling property of synaptic transmission, originally established at the neuromuscular junction, is that the time course of transmitter release is independent of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o), whereas the rate of release is highly [Ca2+]o-dependent. Here, we examine the time course of release at inhibitory basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses and show that it is independent of [Ca2+]o. Modeling of Ca2+-dependent transmitter release suggests that the invariant time course of release critically depends on tight coupling between Ca2+ channels and release sensors. Experiments with exogenous Ca2+ chelators reveal that channel-sensor coupling at basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses is very tight, with a mean distance of 10-20 nm. Thus, tight channel-sensor coupling provides a mechanistic explanation for the apparent [Ca2+]o independence of the time course of release.
The nervous system sends information around the body in the form of electrical signals that travel through cells called neurons. However, these electrical signals cannot cross the synapses between neurons. Instead, the information is carried across the synapse by molecules called neurotransmitters.
