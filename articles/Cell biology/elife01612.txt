 Autophagosomes enclose seemingly random portions of the cytoplasm to supply nutrients during starvation or they can specifically engulf cellular debris to maintain quality control (Mizushima et al., 2011). Although these two pathways share a number of core biochemical steps, the morphology of the isolation membranes can differ greatly. Cup-shaped isolation membranes surround cytosol and organelles upon starvation (Baba et al., 1994). However, when large aggregates of debris accumulate or during xenophagy (Kageyama et al., 2011), autophagosomes form locally on the surface of the substrate and grow in contour with the often irregularly shaped structures that can be much larger than the membrane cups formed during starvation. Furthermore, for large aggregates of mitochondria, several autophagosomes may form simultaneously on different sides of the cargo and fuse together to engulf them (Yoshii et al., 2011). Ubiquitinated protein aggregates may be tagged by LIR (LC3-interacting region) domain-containing proteins that bind LC3 family proteins on isolation membranes to help recruit autophagosomes to the debris (Birgisdottir et al., 2013). However, what links isolation membrane expansion to cargo size is unknown. We recently found that Fis1 null C.elegans and mammalian cells display aberrant LC3 accumulation (Shen et al., 2014). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the association between LC3 accumulation and the loss of Fis1 remains unclear. As TBC1D15 binds to Fis1 (Onoue et al., 2013) and is a Rab-GAP potentially involved in autophagy (Behrends et al., 2010), we made a TBC1D15 gene knock out (KO) cell line using TALENs (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases [Gaj et al., 2013]) and compared the LC3 accumulation phenotype with that of FIS1−/− cells. We designed TALEN binding pairs that target exon 9 of the TBC1D15 gene because it is shared by all conceivable TBC1D15 splicing isoforms. One TBC1D15−/− clone harbors a 14-bp deletion in one allele and a large deletion in the other allele, both of which are frame-shifting and would cause mRNA decay (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We confirmed the knock out of TBC1D15 expression by immunoblotting (Figure 1A). As TBC1D15 was previously reported to mediate mitochondrial fission and bind to Fis1 (Onoue et al., 2013), we checked the expression level of several proteins that have been previously linked to mitochondrial fission pathways in the TBC1D15−/− cells as well as in FIS1−/−, MFF−/−, DRP1−/− and the corresponding WT HCT116 cells (Figure 1A). Although each KO cell line has complete deletion of the target protein, expression and/or stability of the other fission-related proteins was not affected; FIS1−/− and TBC1D15−/− cells possess normal levels of TBC1D15 and Fis1, respectively.10.7554/eLife.01612.003Figure 1.TBC1D15 is dispensable for mitochondria and peroxisome morphologies.(A) Total cell lysates prepared from the indicated HCT116 cell lines were analyzed by immunoblotting.

DNA sequencing confirmed the nucleotide deletions in both alleles of TBC1D15−/− #74 clone.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01612.004 In this study, we identify Rab7, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17, and Fis1 as mitophagy effectors functioning downstream of Parkin to regulate autophagosome morphogenesis. Mitochondrial damage is initially signaled to Parkin through the kinase PINK1 (Youle and Narendra, 2011). As PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of depolarized mitochondria, it recruits Parkin and activates Parkin ubiquitin ligase activity (Iguchi et al., 2013; Lazarou et al., 2013; Zheng and Hunter, 2013). Parkin then modifies numerous mitochondrial outer membrane proteins with K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin signal appears to recruit ULK1, Atg9 and LC3 to the mitochondrion independently of one another to induce mitophagy (Itakura et al., 2012). Our results also indicate that Rab7 is likely activated by a Rab GEF to promote autophagosomal membrane growth and microtubule associated trafficking and that TBC1D15/17 Rab GAP activity is required to temper Rab7 activity to tailor autophagosomal membrane expansion to surround mitochondrial aggregates. Without TBC1D15, or with TBC1D15 lacking Rab GAP activity, LC3/GABARAP-labeled isolation membranes accumulate excessively and without cargo orientation sending long tubules away from mitochondria along microtubule tracks. This suggests that Rab GAP activity localized on the cargo—facing only one side of the expanding LC3 positive isolation membranes—may inhibit Rab7 activity and thereby inhibit membrane expansion proximal to the cargo forcing the growing membrane to tightly wrap odd shaped cargo. Alternatively, perhaps LC3-decorated preautophagosomal structures traffic along microtubules toward Parkin-ubiquitinated mitochondria and fuse together around mitochondrial aggregates where TBC1D15 bound to mitochondria inhibits Rab7 to mediate the release of LC3-bound membranes from microtubules as they contact the mitochondrial cargo (Pankiv et al., 2010). Human LC3B was cloned into BglII/EcoRI sites of pEYFP-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to make YFP-LC3, which was then cloned into BamHI/NotI sites of pCHAC/IRES (Allele Biotechnology, San Diego, CA) to make a retrovirus plasmid pCHAC/YFP-LC3B-IRES-MCS2. To generate a retrovirus mCherry-Parkin plasmid (pBMNz/mCherry-Parkin), the gene for N-terminally mCherry-tagged Parkin (Narendra et al., 2008) was cloned into BamHI/NotI sites of pBMN-Z vector (Addgene plasmid 1734). 2×HA-tagged RAB7A gene from DsRed-rab7 WT (Addgene plasmid 12661) was subcloned into pBABE-puro vector (Addgene plasmid 1764) using BamHI to generate pBABE-puro/2HA-Rab7. YFP-GABARAPL1 was generated by inserting a GABARAPL1 gene into BglII/EcoRI sites of pEYFP-C1 vector. The Y49AL50A mutation in GABARAPL1 and the F52AL53A mutation in LC3B were introduced by primer-based PCR mutagenesis. For GST expression, pGEX-KG vector was used. The following plasmids were also used in this study: pMRX-IP GFP-ULK1 and pMRXs-puro GFP-DFCP1 (kind gifts from Dr Noboru Mizushima), pMXs-IP GFP-Atg14 (Addgene plasmid 38264)
Damaged mitochondria can be selectively eliminated by mitophagy. Although two gene products mutated in Parkinson’s disease, PINK1, and Parkin have been found to play a central role in triggering mitophagy in mammals, how the pre-autophagosomal isolation membrane selectively and accurately engulfs damaged mitochondria remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that TBC1D15, a mitochondrial Rab GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP), governs autophagosome biogenesis and morphology downstream of Parkin activation. To constrain autophagosome morphogenesis to that of the cargo, TBC1D15 inhibits Rab7 activity and associates with both the mitochondria through binding Fis1 and the isolation membrane through the interactions with LC3/GABARAP family members. Another TBC family member TBC1D17, also participates in mitophagy and forms homodimers and heterodimers with TBC1D15. These results demonstrate that TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 mediate proper autophagic encapsulation of mitochondria by regulating Rab7 activity at the interface between mitochondria and isolation membranes.
Parkinson disease is a common degenerative brain disorder that causes tremors, muscle stiffening, and slowing down of movement. Scientists believe that these symptoms are caused by a progressive loss of brain cells called dopaminergic neurons, which help regulate movement. Most cases have no obvious genetic cause, but around 15% of people with the disease have a close relative who also has the disease, and mutations in the genes encoding two proteins—PINK1 and Parkin—have been identified as prime suspects in familial Parkinson disease.
