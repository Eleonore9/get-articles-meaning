 Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone exerting pleiotropic beneficial effects on metabolism (Ye and Scherer, 2013). Increased circulating adiponectin improves the metabolic flexibility of adipose tissue and confers systemic tolerance to obesity (Asterholm and Scherer, 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, adiponectin promotes plasma lipid clearance (Combs et al., 2004; Qiao et al., 2008). To investigate the physiological role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions, we crossed adiponectin null mice (Nawrocki et al., 2006) to the homozygous PANIC-ATTAC background (Wang et al., 2008). The PANIC-ATTAC transgene allows us to eliminate a defined number of β-cells. Starting with similar β-cell mass (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1), 8-week old male homozygous PANIC-ATTACs with adiponectin wild type (P-Adn+/+) or knockout (P-Adn−/−) were treated with the same high-dose of dimerizer AP20187 to induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. 2 weeks after the initial dimerizer administration, the insulin positive areas of P-Adn+/+ and P-Adn−/− mice decreased down to <15% of their starting levels and further decreased down to <10% around 10 weeks post β-cell ablation (Figure 1A and Figure1—figure supplement 1). Different from our previous studies (Wang et al., 2008; Holland et al., 2011), we have used a fairly stringent ablation protocol to obtain a very high level of β-cell loss in both genotypes. In this setting, both the P-Adn+/+ and P-Adn−/− mice showed sustained glucose levels above ∼500 mg/dl (Figure 1B). Their fasting insulin levels decreased to <8% of the euglycemic wild-type (WT) controls after parallel dimerizer treatment (Figure 1C). With such intensive β-cell ablation and insulin deficiency, both the P-Adn+/+ and P-Adn−/− mice were severely glucose intolerant (Figure 1D), and their glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was abolished (Figure 1E).10.7554/eLife.03851.003Figure 1.Adiponectin is required for minimal lipid homeostasis and survival in PANIC-ATTAC mice.Mice with four different genotypes (wildtype [WT]; homozygous PANIC-ATTAC with adiponectin wildtype [P-Adn+/+], adiponectin knockout [P-Adn−/−], or transgenic adiponectin overexpressing mice [P-AdnTg/+]) were exposed to dimerizer.

Related to Figure 1I.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03851.007 In this study, we uncover for the first time a pathological condition under which adiponectin is indispensable for survival. When insulin levels decrease by >90% after intensive β-cell loss, adiponectin ensures the minimal homeostasis for lipid metabolism. Consistent with insulin action promoting lipid storage in adipose tissue, adiponectin exerts a similar effect on lipid uptake, but does so by distinct mechanisms. First, adiponectin mediates lipid uptake specifically in subcutaneous WAT, but not in epididymal WAT. Hepatic VLDL secretion and fatty acid metabolism are unchanged. Second, adiponectin regulates neither lipoprotein lipase activity under insulinopenic conditions nor the intracellular translocation of fatty acids. Rather, caveolin-1 is reduced, thereby reducing endocytosis of lipids. This is in agreement with our previous reports on caveolin-1 knockout mice, which show significantly lower body weight and fat mass than wild-type controls under both regular chow and high-fat diet regimen (Razani et al., 2002; Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2012). Moreover, our adiponectin knockout mice with insulin deficiency recapitulate the lipodystrophic phenotypes reported in caveolin-1 null mice, including impaired triglyceride clearance, hyper-triglyceridemia, adipocyte hypotrophy, without a change in lipoprotein lipase activity (Razani et al., 2002). Third, adiponectin potentiates insulin signaling and the suppression on lipolysis mediated by the trace levels of insulin present. It is tempting to speculate that adiponectin exerts autocrine/paracrine actions on subcutaneous adipose as a hormone, motivating future studies on signaling pathways and transcriptome/proteome analysis under insulinopenic conditions. The generation of mouse models allowing for conditional elimination of both adiponectin receptors adipoR1 and adipoR2 should be insightful. In cases where both insulin and adiponectin are depleted, fat mass becomes critically low, accompanied by exceedingly high triglycerides and ketone bodies in circulation, resulting in major mortality. Mice were bred and maintained on a 12-hr dark/light cycle, with ad libitum access to water and regular chow diet (#5058; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). The strains were generated and previously described by our laboratory: PANIC-ATTAC (Wang et al., 2008), adiponectin overexpressing mice (Combs et al., 2004), and adiponectin null mice (Nawrocki et al., 2006). All mice were maintained on a FVB background. Body composition including fat mass and lean mass were measured with a Bruker Minispec mq10. Food intake was recorded on individually housed mice for 5 consecutive days. All protocols for mouse use and euthanasia were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW).
As an adipokine in circulation, adiponectin has been extensively studied for its beneficial metabolic effects. While many important functions have been attributed to adiponectin under high-fat diet conditions, little is known about its essential role under regular chow. Employing a mouse model with inducible, acute β-cell ablation, we uncovered an essential role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions to maintain minimal lipid homeostasis. When insulin levels are marginal, adiponectin is critical for insulin signaling, endocytosis, and lipid uptake in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. In the absence of both insulin and adiponectin, severe lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia lead to lethality. In contrast, elevated adiponectin levels improve systemic lipid metabolism in the near absence of insulin. Moreover, adiponectin is sufficient to mitigate local lipotoxicity in pancreatic islets, and it promotes reconstitution of β-cell mass, eventually reinstating glycemic control. We uncovered an essential new role for adiponectin, with major implications for type 1 diabetes.
Fat tissue is essential for health. Fat cells store energy and release it when it is needed; they also release hormones that are important for the health of our heart and for regulating our metabolism. One of these hormones, adiponectin, helps cells to remove fat molecules from the bloodstream. This allows the body to maintain appropriate cholesterol levels and prevents fatty build-ups from blocking blood vessels, which is associated with heart disease. Adiponectin also helps cells respond to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, and thus helps to prevent diabetes.
