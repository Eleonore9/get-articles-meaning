 Ca2+ entry in wounded cells triggers a repair mechanism that reseals the plasma membrane (PM) within a few seconds (McNeil et al., 2003). Ca2+ influx induces exocytosis of lysosomes, a process required for PM resealing (Reddy et al., 2001). PM repair was initially suggested to be mediated by a membrane patch applied to the wound site (Miyake and McNeil, 1995), or through exocytosis-mediated reduction in PM tension (Togo et al., 2000). However, Ca2+-dependent lysosomal exocytosis is also required for the resealing of cells injured by pore-forming toxins (Walev et al., 2001; Idone et al., 2008). These toxins generate stable, protein-lined transmembrane lesions that cannot be resealed by a membrane patch or simply by relieving PM tension. Recent studies clarified this issue, by showing that lysosomal exocytosis in wounded cells is followed by a rapid, cholesterol-dependent form of endocytosis that removes pores and lesions from the PM (Idone et al., 2008) and directs them to lysosomes for degradation (Corrotte et al., 2012). Prior studies suggested that ASM released from lysosomes during cell wounding triggers formation of ceramide-enriched endocytic vesicles (Tam et al., 2010). By performing cryo-immuno EM assays with specific anti-ceramide antibodies (Fernandes et al., 2011) we detected anti-ceramide reactivity throughout the cytoplasm and in small clusters near the PM of NRK cells (Figure 1A,B, control). An isotype control antibody showed little, if any, labeling in the same preparations (not shown). Treatment with purified Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase (SM) for 30 s enhanced the anti-ceramide staining along the PM. Permeabilization with the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO) had a similar effect, rapidly increasing the anti-ceramide reactivity at the cell periphery (Figure 1A,B). These results suggested that injury with SLO or exposure to SM triggered the formation of ceramide-enriched structures that might represent PM invaginations or intracellular vesicles.10.7554/eLife.00926.003Figure 1.Caveolae-like vesicles accumulate in cells exposed to SLO and sphingomyelinase.(A) Cryo-immuno EM with anti-ceramide in NRK cells untreated or exposed to SLO or SM for 30 s.

The results are representative of two independent blinded quantifications performed by two independent investigators.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00926.004 The goal of this study was to investigate the abundant, cholesterol-dependent endocytic compartments that accumulate in several cell types after PM wounding (Idone et al., 2008; Thiery et al., 2011). Strikingly, our results revealed that a large fraction of the endocytic vesicles formed a few seconds after injury resemble caveolae, the ubiquitous flask-shaped PM invaginations that have been implicated in transcytosis, mechanosensing and signaling responses (Parton and Simons, 2007; Lajoie and Nabi, 2010). Wounded cells show increased numbers of small, homogeneously shaped vesicles with the typical morphology and markers of caveolae. Several independent lines of evidence demonstrate that internalization of these vesicles occurs rapidly, with a time-course that matches the kinetics of PM repair. Cryo-immuno EM, endocytosis and live imaging assays showed that the pore-forming toxin SLO is removed from the PM and traffics into cells in vesicular carriers containing the caveolar marker Cav1. Furthermore, transcriptional silencing of Cav1 in non-muscle cells and Cav3 in myotubes inhibits caveolae formation and PM repair. Collectively, our study identifies caveolar vesicles as dynamic endocytic structures that play a key role in the restoration of PM integrity. NRK and HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 in high glucose DME containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The C2C12 mouse myogenic cell line (CRL-1772), a subclone of mouse skeletal muscle C2 cells (Blau et al., 1983), was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). C2C12 were grown to confluency at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DME supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The medium was then changed to DME containing 2% horse serum and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin to trigger myogenic differentiation. The cells were maintained in this medium for 4-7 days, with fresh medium added every second day.
Rapid repair of plasma membrane wounds is critical for cellular survival. Muscle fibers are particularly susceptible to injury, and defective sarcolemma resealing causes muscular dystrophy. Caveolae accumulate in dystrophic muscle fibers and caveolin and cavin mutations cause muscle pathology, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that muscle fibers and other cell types repair membrane wounds by a mechanism involving Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes, release of acid sphingomyelinase, and rapid lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis. Wounding or exposure to sphingomyelinase triggered endocytosis and intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, which gradually merged into larger compartments. The pore-forming toxin SLO was directly visualized entering cells within caveolar vesicles, and depletion of caveolin inhibited plasma membrane resealing. Our findings directly link lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis to the maintenance of plasma membrane and muscle fiber integrity, providing a mechanistic explanation for the muscle pathology associated with mutations in caveolae proteins.
Cells must be able to rapidly repair damage to their outer membranes. This is particularly important in the case of muscle cells, which are vulnerable to damage, and the failure of these cells to repair their outer membranes leads to the muscle wastage seen in muscular dystrophy. Researchers do not fully understand how cells repair membrane, but one popular theory is that they use the membranes of specialized vesicles to ‘patch’ areas that have been damaged.
