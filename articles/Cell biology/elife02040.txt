 The fundamental process by which a cell controls its own size is not understood for any cell type. In actively dividing cells, growth, and size need to be coordinated for cells to maintain their size. In several cell types, cells have been shown to have a size threshold, in which they need to grow to a minimal cell size before committing to cell division (Turner et al., 2012). This mechanism however requires that cells somehow monitor their own size. The molecular mechanism for how size is sensed, and what aspect of size—surface area, volume, mass, linear dimensions etc—is monitored remains unknown. To test the pom1p gradient model, we quantitatively analyzed pom1p in living cells expressing a functional pom1-tomato-dimer fusion protein at near-endogenous levels (Padte et al., 2006; Hachet et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2012). Pom1p cortical gradients exhibit large cell-to-cell variability in intensity and distribution, fluctuate over time in individual cells, and show little consistent change with cell length (Saunders et al., 2012). This variability, plus a short decay length relative to cell length, led us to question whether these gradients can function reliably as ‘rulers’. One of the key predictions of the gradient-based model is that pom1p levels decrease on the medial cortex as cells grow. We measured pom1p concentration in a 3-µm region along the medial cortex, where cdr2p nodes are located. Using time-averaged data (reducing fluctuations in the gradient over time [Saunders et al., 2012]), we detected low but measurable intensities (Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Importantly, measurements of pom1-tomato at the medial cortex showed no detectable decrease with cell length in a population of cells (Figure 1B), or in individual cells imaged over time (Figure 1C,D). These cortical measurements improve on previously reported pom1p measurements that integrate intensities over the whole cell (Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009; Moseley et al., 2009), which have artifacts stemming from the normal exclusion of pom1p from the nucleus (Saunders et al., 2012; Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 2,3).10.7554/eLife.02040.003Figure 1.Gradient distribution of pom1p is not the basis for cell size control.(A) Time-averaged spinning disc confocal images of fission yeast cells expressing pom1-tomato in a medial focal plane (60 frames over 3 min).

(2009) and Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean (2009) showed, in contrast to what we see, that pom1p levels in the middle of the cell decrease with cell length. In the measurements of these papers, pom1p fluorescence in the whole cell was collapsed onto a single line. This method of image analysis differs from our approach of measuring pom1p intensity only on the cortex, where the gradient distribution is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We plotted measurements of pom1p in the middle of the cell as a function of cell length using different methods and data sets. The data from Moseley et al. (Figure S12 of that publication) is presented here (after normalization to the value for cells with length <8.5 μm) as the black bars. We found a similar trend using the same whole cell analysis on our own images of pom1-tomato cells (blue bars), n > 20 in each binning of cell lengths. pom1p is detectable at a low constant level all through the cytoplasm, but is not detectable in the nucleus (Saunders et al., 2012; Figure 1A). Therefore, we tested whether this difference between whole cell and cortical measurements may be due to lack of pom1p in the nucleus. We adjusted for the effect of the nucleus by filling the nucleus with the average cytoplasmic pom1p intensity in silico. This adjustment largely abrogated the length-dependent decrease of pom1p intensity (red bars). We speculate that the decrease seen in the whole cell measurements may be due to the slightly larger size of the nucleus in larger cells (Neumann and Nurse, 2007; Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Thus, the decrease seen in the previous publications may (partially) be an artifact of including cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence in addition to the cortical distribution. Strain used: FC2054.

Dashed red line corresponds to the unscaled pom1-GFP absolute fluorescence values in the cell. The pom1-GFP intensity is adjusted to account for the relative intensity difference (whole cell pom1-3GFP was 2.5 times more intense than pom1-GFP under the same imaging conditions). These data show that these gradients have similar numbers of pom1p molecules at their peaks. Strains used: FC2685, FC1162. Error bars not shown for clarity. (B) Fitted decay length of average pom1p intensity profile for three different fluorescent proteins (pom1-3GFP (n = 45 cells), pom1-GFP (n = 31 cells) and pom1-tomato (n = 32 cells)). Strains used: FC2685, FC1162 and FC2054. Note that these cells express the fusion as the only pom1p protein in the cell. Errors are estimated from the fitting of an exponential curve to the average profile for each pom1 fusion. Intensity profiles are normalized to have the same intensity at the cell centers. We have confirmed that different normalizations (and also fitting to the raw data) do not significantly alter the measured decay lengths (data not shown). (C) Ratio of distributions of cdr2p nodes in cells with different pom1p gradient distributions. Maximum projection confocal images of cdr2-tomato in pom1-GFP (n = 49 cells) and pom1-3GFP (n = 50 cells) strains were acquired and nodes were specified by a thresholding approach (‘Materials and methods’). The ratio is defined as the area of the cdr2p nodes in the pom1-GFP strain divided by the area of the cdr2p nodes in the pom1-3GFP strain. Black line is guide to the eye for ratio of one.

We provide evidence that cells sense a critical cell size by measuring cell surface area rather than, for example, cell volume or absolute length, a mechanism that could function regardless of the cell shape. As the cell grows, the concentration of cdr2p at the medial cortex increases. We have developed models explaining how cdr2p probes the surface area of the cell, and conveys this information to the medial cortex. There, cdr2p may signal to cell cycle regulators located on the nearby spindle pole body and nucleus (see below). When the cell reaches a critical size, cdr2p at the nodes may reach a critical local concentration that promotes mitotic entry. Standard methods for S. pombe growth and genetics were used (Moreno et al., 1991). In general, strains were constructed using a PCR-based homologous recombination method to insert markers in the yeast chromosome (Bahler et al., 1998). Pom1-mGFP (= pom1-GFP) and pom1-3GFP strains were constructed by inserting mGFP and 3GFP constructs into the pom1+ chromosomal locus from fragments amplified from pFA6a-mGFP-kanMX6 (monomeric GFP A206K [Zacharias et al., 2002]) and pFA6a-3GFP-kanMX6 (triple tandem GFP) (Wu and Pollard, 2005; Martin and Chang, 2006), (from JQ Wu). In general, constructs were checked by PCR and sequencing, and strains were outcrossed multiple times.
Cells can, in principle, control their size by growing to a specified size before commencing cell division. How any cell actually senses its own size remains poorly understood. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are rod-shaped cells that grow to ∼14 µm in length before entering mitosis. In this study, we provide evidence that these cells sense their surface area as part of this size control mechanism. We show that cells enter mitosis at a certain surface area, as opposed to a certain volume or length. A peripheral membrane protein kinase cdr2p has properties of a dose-dependent ‘sizer’ that controls mitotic entry. As cells grow, the local cdr2p concentration in nodes at the medial cortex accumulates as a measure of cell surface area. Our findings, which challenge a previously proposed pom1p gradient model, lead to a new model in which cells sense their size by using cdr2p to probe the surface area over the whole cell and relay this information to the medial cortex.
Although different types of cells come in a variety of shapes and sizes, most cells are able to maintain a fairly consistent size and shape as they grow and divide. For example, the rod-shaped cells of the fission yeast S. pombe grow to be 14 microns long before dividing in the middle to form two new cells. This prevents any single cell becoming too large or small.
