 Store-operated calcium entry or SOCE is activated in response to the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores, and constitutes a primary mechanism of calcium influx in excitable and non-excitable cells (Parekh and Putney, 2005). Store-operated calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels have been extensively studied for their role in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) regulated gene expression in lymphocytes and other cells (Lewis, 2001; Crabtree and Olson, 2002; Feske et al., 2005; Parekh and Putney, 2005; Vig and Kinet, 2009). Previously, genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila cell lines led to the identification of ER-resident STIMs as the store sensors and plasma membrane (PM) resident Orai/CRACMs as the pore forming subunit of CRAC channels (Liou et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005, 2006; Feske et al., 2006; Peinelt et al., 2006; Prakriya et al., 2006; Yeromin et al., 2006; Vig et al., 2006a, 2006b). Stim1, and its homolog Stim2, contain a calcium-sensing EF-hand like domain facing the ER lumen. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 oligomerizes and concentrates in regions of ER directly adjacent to the PM, frequently referred to as junctional ER (Liou et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Stathopulos et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006; Liou et al., 2007; Luik et al., 2008; Stathopulos et al., 2008). While some factors involved in store-dependent and store-independent Stim1 clustering have been described (Honnappa et al., 2009; Smyth et al., 2009; Srikanth et al., 2010, 2012; Walsh et al., 2010b; Krapivinsky et al., 2011; Lewis, 2011; Singaravelu et al., 2011), little is known about the final steps in CRAC channel activation. For instance, Orai1 multimers are thought to diffuse freely until trapped by Stim1 clusters in the ER-PM junctions, with active CRAC channels consisting of Orai1 hexamers (Penna et al., 2008; Park et al., 2009; Madl et al., 2010; Walsh et al., 2010a; Hou et al., 2012), however, it remains unexplored whether mere trapping of Orai1 by Stim1 in ER-PM junctions is sufficient or additional molecular steps enable optimal activation of SOCE. We hypothesized that additional cytosolic proteins might be necessary to impart functionality to Stim1-Orai1 clusters that constitute the CRAC channel complex and adopted a candidate-based approach based on our earlier genome-wide RNAi screen (Vig et al., 2006b). To test our hypothesis that additional proteins are needed to facilitate SOCE under physiological conditions, we used ∼200 to 500 base pair long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to deplete the expression of six genes that we previously identified as candidates in a genome-wide RNAi screen (Vig et al., 2006b) in Drosophila Kc cells. We found that knockdown of soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) strongly reduces SOCE by day 3 (Figure 1A and Supplementary file 1). Given the almost complete inhibition of SOCE in SNAP deficient Drosophila cells, we hypothesized that SNAP might engage in novel, SOCE specific protein-protein interactions that may or may not involve NSF and SNAREs. α- and β-SNAP are the two mammalian proteins most closely related to Drosophila SNAP (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). α-SNAP is ubiquitously expressed while β-SNAP expression is largely restricted to the brain. We depleted α-SNAP in HEK-293 (Figure 1B), Jurkat T cells (Figure 1C) and U2OS cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) using lentivirus-based RNAi constructs (Supplementary file 1) and found SOCE to be strongly inhibited by day three compared to cells treated with control RNAi. By day five, depletion of α-SNAP caused cell rounding in adherent cell lines; we therefore restricted our analysis to adherent cells at early time-points. We confirmed the efficiency of α-SNAP knockdown for each experiment on western blots of whole cell lysates (WCLs) (Figure 1D) and by immunostaining cells with anti-α-SNAP antibody (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Importantly, when we reconstituted α-SNAP deficient HEK 293 cells with an RNAi resistant version of α-SNAP we found that SOCE was largely restored (Figure 1E). Defective SOCE in α-SNAP deficient HEK 293 cells could also be restored by over-expressing β-SNAP (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). γ-SNAP is a third SNAP protein widely expressed in mammalian tissues but is less similar to Drosophila SNAP and α-SNAP than β-SNAP (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). γ-SNAP depletion failed to inhibit SOCE in HEK 293 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) and γ-SNAP over-expression did not compensate for α-SNAP depletion (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).10.7554/eLife.00802.003Figure 1.α-SNAP depletion inhibits SOCE and NFAT activation.(A) Average Fura-2 ratios of Drosophila Kc cells treated with dsRNA targeting SNAP (red) or Rho-1 (black) for 3 days, and stimulated with 1 μM TG to measure SOCE using flexstation.

Regulation of SOCE by α-SNAP is completely independent of its well-known role in NSF mediated SNARE complex disassembly. We demonstrate that Stim1-Orai1 clustering at ER-PM junctions is insufficient to fully activate SOCE unless followed by a α-SNAP dependent active molecular re-arrangement within CRAC channel clusters. Furthermore, our study opens the possibility that SNAP proteins are involved in organizing other membrane associated macromolecular complexes. Orai1-Myc and Flag-Orai1, and Stim1-Myc plasmids have been described previously (Peinelt et al., 2006; Vig et al., 2006b). To generate Orai1-CFP and Orai1-YFP, human Orai1 was sub cloned into YFP-N1 and CFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). YFP-STIM1 and CFP-STIM1 were a gift from Dr Tobias Meyer’s lab. Full-length human α-SNAP, β-SNAP, and γ-SNAP were amplified from human cDNA libraries and cloned into pcDNA/4TO/Myc-His (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) vectors. Stim1 cytosolic domains and Orai1 N- and C- tails were cloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and named as GST-CT (235-685aa), GST-CC1-CAD (235-448aa), GST-CC1 (235-344aa), and GST-CAD (342-448aa) for Stim1 domains and GST-Orai1-NT (1-87aa) and GST-Orai1-CT (228-301aa) for Orai1 domains. All plasmid DNA transfections were done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Amaxa nucleofection kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels constitutes a primary route of calcium entry in most cells. Orai1 forms the pore subunit of CRAC channels and Stim1 is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident Ca2+ sensor. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 translocates to domains of ER adjacent to the plasma membrane where it interacts with and clusters Orai1 hexamers to form the CRAC channel complex. Molecular steps enabling activation of SOCE via CRAC channel clusters remain incompletely defined. Here we identify an essential role of α-SNAP in mediating functional coupling of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules to activate SOCE. This role for α-SNAP is direct and independent of its known activity in NSF dependent SNARE complex disassembly. Importantly, Stim1-Orai1 clustering still occurs in the absence of α-SNAP but its inability to support SOCE reveals that a previously unsuspected molecular re-arrangement within CRAC channel clusters is necessary for SOCE.
Calcium is an essential element for many biological functions. In particular, the movement of calcium ions through the cell membrane has a central role in many of the signalling pathways that cells use to communicate with other cells. Signals are produced by calcium ions both entering and leaving the cell, with information being contained in the rate, location, and duration of the flow of ions.
