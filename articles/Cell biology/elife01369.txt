 In eukaryotic cells, secretory and membrane proteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this protein maturation process, nascent polypeptides need to pass stringent checkpoints monitored by a sophisticated quality control program. Only correctly folded proteins can exit the ER and reach their final destinations, whereas terminally misfolded or unassembled polypeptides are retained and eliminated by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system (Vembar and Brodsky, 2008; Smith et al., 2011). This mechanism not only adapts cells to proteotoxic stress (Balch et al., 2008), but also fine-tunes signaling processes essential for the development of multicellular organisms (Ron and Walter, 2007). USP13 shares ∼80% sequence similarity to USP5 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), an isopeptidase that preferentially cleaves unanchored ubiquitin chains (Reyes-Turcu et al., 2006). However, only USP13, but not USP5 has been implicated in ERAD. To understand how these homologous enzymes can have distinct functions, we first purified recombinant USP13 and USP5 from both mammalian cells and Escherichia coli. We tested their ability to bind free ubiquitin and to cleave ubiquitin-AFC (Ub-AFC) in vitro. Interestingly, USP5 readily bound to free ubiquitin and cleaved Ub-AFC with high efficiency, whereas USP13 was almost completely inactive (Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C). USP13 could not efficiently cleave K48- or K63-linked di-ubiquitin either (data not shown). We next generated and purified USP13 mutants in each of which a fragment in USP13 was replaced by a corresponding segment in USP5 (Figure 1B). Ub-AFC assay showed that the chimera (USP13/5-4) in which the first 722 amino acids of USP13 were replaced with a corresponding segment in USP5 still had no deubiquitinating activity. However, further incorporation of a USP5 segment encompassing the second ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (amino acids 717-781) to USP13 (USP13/5-5) led to an activity similar to that of USP5 (Figure 1B,C). These data suggest that USP13 and USP5 are distinct deubiquitinases and the second UBA domain accounts for the differential activities of these enzymes.10.7554/eLife.01369.003Figure 1.USP13 and USP5 have distinct activities despite sequence homology.(A) Purified USP13 is inactive whereas USP5 is active.

Despite having opposing activities, these enzymes interact with each other to form a complex that coordinately promotes ERAD. We identify the Bag6 cofactor Ubl4A as a shared substrate of gp78 and USP13. USP13 depletion is associated with hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A and altered interaction between the Bag6 complex and its co-chaperone SGTA. SGTA is an ortholog of Sgt2p, a chaperone implicated in biogenesis of tail-anchored ER proteins in S. cerevisiae (Wang et al., 2010). Like Bag6, SGTA also contains a chaperone-like activity that preferentially binds hydrophobic segments. We recently demonstrated that this activity facilitates substrate binding by Bag6 in ERAD (Xu et al., 2012). We also showed that the interaction of Bag6 with SGTA is facilitated by Ubl4A as the latter binds directly to SGTA in a highly dynamic manner (Chartron et al., 2012). Because the interaction of Ubl4A with SGTA is mediated by positively-charged residues in Ubl4A including Lys48 (Chartron et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012), which happens to be the major ubiquitination site, the simplest model to explain reduced Bag6-SGTA interaction in USP13 knockdown cells is that ubiquitin conjugates on Ubl4A sterically hinder SGTA binding. However, given that USP13 can also interact physically with Bag6, it is also possible that USP13 may serve an adaptor function to promote Bag6-SGTA interaction. The HEK293 cell line stably expressing TCRα-YFP was described previously (Soetandyo et al., 2010). Mammalian expression constructs for Ufd1, Npl4, Derlin-1, Ube2g2, VIMP, Hrd1, and gp78 were described previously (Ye et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Li et al., 2007). Constructs for expression of UbxD8, ASPL, UbxD5, SAK1, FAF1, UbxD1, UbxD7, p47 were kindly provided by R Deshaies (Caltech, Pasadena, CA) (Alexandru et al., 2008). FLAG-USP13 and FLAG-USP5 expression plasmids were constructed by cloning the corresponding cDNA into the SalI and NotI sites of the pRK5-FLAG vector (Li et al., 2008). The USP5/USP13 chimera constructs were made by fusing USP5 and USP13 DNA fragments (as indicated in Figure 1B) using a ‘sewing’ PCR method. GST-USP13 and GST-USP5 were made by cloning the coding regions of USP13 or USP5 to the SalI and NotI sites in the pET42c(+) vector (Novagen/Merck, Germany). The pET42-Bag6 UBL and pET42-Ubl4A UBL constructs were described previously (Xu et al., 2012). Constructs for expression of Erasin and gp78 shRNA were provided by M Monteiro, and S Fang, respectively (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). Plasmids for expression of Bag6 and its truncated variants were generated by cloning the coding DNA fragments as indicated in Figure 4 into the EcoRV and NotI sites in the pRK5-FLAG vector. Plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged Ubl4A and FLAG-tagged SGTA were purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). To generate the gp78 RING mutant for mammalian expression, Cys356 and His361 in the gp78 RING domain were converted to Glycine and Alanine, respectively. The pGEX-gp78c Rm construct was described previously (Li et al., 2007). The constructs for expression of the various GST-gp78c truncation mutants were generated by a PCR-based mutagenesis approach using the pGEX-gp78c as the template and the TagMaster Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit from GM Biosciences (Frederick, MD). Other point mutations were generated by PCR based site-directed mutagenesis following a standard protocol. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To construct pCMV- Ub-Ubl4A, ubiquitin-coding sequence bearing a G76V mutation was first cloned into pET28a using the NdeI and SalI sites. Ubl4A coding sequence was then inserted downstream of Ub-G76V using HindIII and XhoI sites. The whole Ub-G76V-Ubl4A fragment was then amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCMV6-ENTRY vector using the SgfI and MluI sites. For USP13 knockdown experiments, the targeting sequences are as follows:USP13-1 shRNA: cctgaatacttggtagtgcagataaagaaUSP13-2 shRNA: gcgcatgtttaaggcctttgt
Physiological adaptation to proteotoxic stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins into the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and elimination by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). A surprising paradox emerging from recent studies is that ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinases (DUBs), enzymes with opposing activities, can both promote ERAD. Here we demonstrate that the ERAD E3 gp78 can ubiquitinate not only ERAD substrates, but also the machinery protein Ubl4A, a key component of the Bag6 chaperone complex. Remarkably, instead of targeting Ubl4A for degradation, polyubiquitination is associated with irreversible proteolytic processing and inactivation of Bag6. Importantly, we identify USP13 as a gp78-associated DUB that eliminates ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A to maintain the functionality of Bag6. Our study reveals an unexpected paradigm in which a DUB prevents undesired ubiquitination to sharpen substrate specificity for an associated ubiquitin ligase partner and to promote ER quality control.
Cells make proteins inside a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. However, some of these proteins cannot fold into the correct shape, so cells rely on a process called the ERAD pathway to degrade and eliminate these faulty proteins. First, however, the misfolded proteins must be moved from the endoplasmic reticulum to the main body of the cell (the cytosol).
