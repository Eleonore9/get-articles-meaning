 Mitochondria exhibit a complex topology encompassing two membranes that create distinct internal compartments. The inner membrane (IM) runs parallel to the outer membrane (OM) at regions called inner boundary membranes (IBM) and invaginates into the mitochondrial matrix forming the cristae structures which connect to the inter membrane space (IMS) through narrow openings (Freya and Mannellab, 2000). This intricate architecture is maintained by structures called cristae junctions (CJs) and contact sites (CSs) and has been shown to be essential for numerous mitochondrial pathways such as protein import, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis (Freya and Mannellab, 2000; Vogel et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2012; Cogliati et al., 2013). In order to examine the composition of the MICOS complex using interaction proteomics, open reading frames for MIC27, MIC19, MIC25, MIC60, MTX2, and DNAJC11 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A shows a schematic representation of the MICOS complex where the MICOS subunits and interactors used for our IP-MS approach are depicted in red) were C-terminally tagged with an HA-FLAG epitope in a lentiviral vector and expressed stably in 293T and HeLa cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Confocal microscopy after immunostaining with α-HA and α-TOMM20 verified that each protein was targeted to mitochondria in HeLa cells (Figure 1A). To identify high confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs), we employed a modified version of the ComPASS platform (Sowa et al., 2009). This method uses a large collection of parallel AP-MS experiments to generate a database populated with peptide spectral matches, allowing the frequency, abundance, and reproducibility of interacting proteins to be determined. To enhance detection of membrane-associated proteins, we employed 1% digitonin, and proteins were purified using α-FLAG beads. After extensive washing, complexes were trypsinized prior to proteomic analysis. As a validation approach, three of the baits (MIC60, MTX2, and MIC19) were also expressed in HCT116 cells and immunopurified with a different antibody (α-HA). Interaction data are summarized in Figure 1B (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 contains the entire data set). Overall, the interaction network contained 26 proteins and 97 interactions (edges) after filtering as described in the ‘Materials and methods’. The six baits analyzed showed extensive reciprocal connectivity (Figure 1B). Confirming previously reported data, several core subunits of the MICOS complex (MIC19, MIC25, MIC60, MIC26, MIC27) also associated with known interactors at the OM (SAMM50, MTX1 and MTX2), indicating that our method is able to retrieve nearly all known subunits and interactors of the MICOS complex, located at the IM, IMS, and OM with high confidence. In addition to known interactors, our map also revealed potential novel interacting partners, associated with one or more MICOS subunits. These include two OM proteins, the MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the RHOT2 GTPase involved in mitochondrial trafficking (Figure 1B). RHOT2 has been shown to co-fractionate with SAMM50 in correlation profiling proteomic experiments (Havugimana et al., 2012). In addition, we identified TMEM11 as a protein associated with multiple MICOS subunits and capable of associating with MIC60 endogenously (Figure 1B,F). A TMEM11 ortholog in Drosophila has been shown genetically to be required for cristae organization and biogenesis, but the mechanisms involved are unknown (Rival et al., 2011; Macchi et al., 2013). Our results indicate that TMEM11 may function in these processes in association with the MICOS complex. Components of the MICOS complex were not detected in GFP-FLAG immune complexes prepared similarly (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), pointing the specificity of the interactions observed.10.7554/eLife.06265.003Figure 1.Interaction proteomics of the MICOS complex reveals QIL1 as a novel interactor.(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of the subcellular localization of tagged proteins.

Protein Assembler was used to convert spectral counts to APSMs. Peptide data (APSMs) were uploaded into the CompPASS algorithm housed within the CORE environment. Interaction confidence was ranked according to the NWD scores (Sowa et al., 2009). The results obtained from the CompPASS analysis were filtered to determine proteins with a NWD score>1 or high confidence interactors (HCIPs). HCIPs were then filtered for mitochondrial proteins based on the proteins present in Mitocarta (Pagliarini et al., 2008). For the 293T data set, HCIPs with 2 or more ASPMs were included.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06265.005 In this work, we report a systematic proteomic analysis of the MICOS complex and identify QIL1 as a new subunit required for CJ formation, MICOS complex maturation, and mitochondrial homeostasis. QIL1 associates with the core IM MICOS complex, the cardiolipin binding subunits (MIC26 and MIC27), as well as the SAMM50-MTX1-MTX2 OM complex (Figure 1C). Moreover, QIL1 is enriched at CJs to an extent similar to that of the MICOS subunit MIC25 and is present in a ∼700 kDa complex, as observed by BN-PAGE (Figure 2). Thus, QIL1 may be a central component of CJs and the machinery that connects inner and outer membranes (Figure 8). Indeed, depletion of QIL1 leads to MICOS-like defects in cristae morphology, with loss of CJs and formation of swirls of cristae membranes inside mitochondria (Figure 3A-H). QIL1 is conserved in Drosophila where its depletion also causes mitochondrial phenotypes (Figure 4). Moreover, QIL1 knockdown resulted in MICOS disassembly, accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and loss of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 from the MICOS complex, as determined by quantitative proteomics and immunoblot analysis (Figure 5A-D).10.7554/eLife.06265.013Figure 8.QIL1 is a novel MICOS subunit required for MICOS assembly.Model for QIL1 incorporation into the MICOS complex and the effect of loss of QIL1 on the composition of MICOS subunits. We propose that MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 fail to assemble into a stable MICOS sub-complex containing MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 and are degraded when QIL1 is depleted leading to MICOS disassembly, loss of CJs and cristae morphology defects.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06265.013 HCT116, HeLa, HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.
The mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction (CJ) organizing system (MICOS) dynamically regulate mitochondrial membrane architecture. Through systematic proteomic analysis of human MICOS, we identified QIL1 (C19orf70) as a novel conserved MICOS subunit. QIL1 depletion disrupted CJ structure in cultured human cells and in Drosophila muscle and neuronal cells in vivo. In human cells, mitochondrial disruption correlated with impaired respiration. Moreover, increased mitochondrial fragmentation was observed upon QIL1 depletion in flies. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that loss of QIL1 resulted in MICOS disassembly with the accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and degradation of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. Additionally, we demonstrated that in QIL1-depleted cells, overexpressed MIC10 fails to significantly restore its interaction with other MICOS subunits and SAMM50. Collectively, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized subunit of the MICOS complex, necessary for CJ integrity, cristae morphology, and mitochondrial function and provides a resource for further analysis of MICOS architecture.
Mitochondria are the cell's power plants, and churn out molecules that provide a portable energy source throughout the cell. To do this efficiently, the mitochondria have a double membrane. The inner membrane is ruffled, which provides a large surface area for energy-producing reactions to occur on. Structures called cristae junctions and contact sites hold the folds of the inner membrane in place.
