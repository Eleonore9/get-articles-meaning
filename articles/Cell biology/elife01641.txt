 When mitotic chromosomes are examined by whole mount microscopy the surface chromatin is obscured by a layer of proteins and RNA derived from the dense fibrillar component (DFC) and granular component (GC) of the nucleolus (Moyne and Garrido, 1976; Harrison et al., 1982; Adolph and Kreisman, 1983; Sumner, 1991; Gautier et al., 1992b; Wanner et al., 2005). This perichromosomal layer includes pre-rRNA, U3 snoRNAs, and over 20 ribosomal proteins, including nucleolin and Nopp140, NPM/B23, Bop1, Nop52, PM-Scl 100, and Ki-67 (Gautier et al., 1992a, 1994; Hernandez-Verdun and Gautier, 1994; Van Hooser et al., 2005; Fomproix et al., 1998; Angelier et al., 2005). The perichromosomal layer represents 1.4% of the chromosome proteome (Ohta et al., 2010). At present, its functional significance remains unstudied (Van Hooser et al., 2005). We used a phylogenetic approach to identify putative functional regions within the sequence of Repo-Man, a targeting protein that binds PP1 in a cell-cycle specific manner regulated by a phospho-switch (Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2011; Vagnarelli et al., 2011). A BLAST search revealed significant (E = 5 × 10−4) similarity between a small region (amino acids 388-420) of human Repo-Man and Ki-67 (Figure 1A1,2), a very large protein that exhibits strong links to cell proliferation (Gerdes et al., 1983). The region conserved between Repo-Man and Ki-67 contains the PP1 binding motif (RVTF) of Repo-Man, which is conserved as RVSF in human Ki-67 (Figure 1C3).10.7554/eLife.01641.003Figure 1.Ki-67 is evolutionary related to Repo-Man but shows distinct behaviour during mitosis.(A1) Schematic representations of evolutionarily conserved regions in human Repo-Man and Ki-67 proteins (shown approximately to scale). (A2) E-values corresponding to global profile-to-sequence (HMMer3) comparisons between the PP1 binding conserved regions (blue oval) in Repo-Man and Ki-67 families. Arrows indicate the profile search direction. The Repo-Man profile identified Ki-67 proteins as homologous with a highly significant E-value of 4.9 × 10−11. Conversely, the profile of Ki-67 homologous sequences in animals identified Repo-Man proteins with a significant E-value of 9.9 × 10−13. (A3) Representative multiple sequence alignment of conserved regions from Repo-Man and Ki-67 families. Important mitotic phospho-residues in Repo-Man (T412 and T419) are indicated in blue. The RVTF motif is indicated with an orange box. The most parsimonious explanation of Repo-Man and Ki-67 evolution is shown to the left of the alignment. Vertebrate branches are coloured in blue. Sequences are named according to: Repo_Human, NCBI:NP_689775, Homo sapiens; Repo_Frog, NCBI:ACR33033, Xenopus laevis; Repo_Danre, UniProt:A2CEF0, Danio rerio; Ki_Human, UniProt:P46013, Homo sapiens; Ki_Frog, UniProt:Q0VA85, Xenopus laevis; Ki_Fugu, UniProt:UPI00016EA029, Takifugu rubripes; Ki_Cioin, UniProt:UPI000180CFDA, Ciona intestinalis; Ki_Sacko, Baylor College of Medicine genome and FGENESH+, Saccoglossus kowalevskii; Ki_Hydra, UniProt:UPI0001926DD5, Hydra magnipapillata; and, Ki_Triad, UniProt:B3SB24, Trichoplax adhaerens. The amino acid colouring scheme indicates average BLOSUM62 scores (which are correlated with amino acid conservation) for each alignment column: red (greater than 3.5), violet (between 3.5 and 2.5), and light yellow (between 2.5 and 0.5). (B-C) Ki-67 and PP1γ interact in vivo. Ki-67301-700 fused to Lac repressor:GFP (Lac repressor:Ki-67PP1BD_wt) was transfected together with RFP:PP1γ into a DT40 cell line containing a LacO array integrated on a single chromosome. Ki-67 was enriched at the LacO site (panels 2, 2′) where it recruited PP1γ (2, 2″). However, neither Lac repressor:GFP (panels 1-1″) or the Ki-67 PP1-non-binding mutant (Lac repressor:Ki-67PP1BD_RASA) (panels 3-3″) caused PP1 accumulation at the LacO site. (D) Ki-67 recruits PP1γ more efficiently than PP1beta and more efficiently in interphase than in mitosis. The experimental set up was as in (B). The enrichment of PP1 signal at the Lac repressor spot was compared to the background nuclear (interphase) or cytoplasmic (mitosis) signal within the same cell. Scale bar 10 μm. (E) Direct and indirect interactors of Ki-67. (F) The B23S125 phosphorylation level remains high in Ki-67 depleted mitotic cells. Immunoblots of whole cell extracts of cycling (interphase) of Nocodazole-arrested (mitotic) HeLa cells transfected with Ki-67 RNAi oligo 5 or control oligos, were probed for Ki-67, tubulin, B23T199ph, and B23S125ph. Two exposures of the B23S125ph blot are shown.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01641.00310.7554/eLife.01641.004Figure 1—figure supplement 1.Characterisation of Ki-67 RNAi.Two siRNAs against Ki-67 deplete the protein efficiently in HeLa cells.

HeLa cells were transfected with RFP:PP1γ (green) and with oligo 5 (panels 4-6) or control oligo (panels 1-3). Scale bar 5 μm.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01641.005 The perichromosomal layer is a little-studied structure whose existence was mentioned in classical studies of mitotic chromosomes (Schrader, 1944), but only became widely accepted once its constituents could be described as a result of staining with specific antibodies (Van Hooser et al., 2005). Functions proposed for the perichromosomal layer include acting as a protective sheath or pellicle around the chromosomes (Schrader, 1944; Yasuda and Maul, 1990), serving a role in chromosome condensation or structure (Gautier et al., 1992c; Takagi et al., 1999; Kametaka et al., 2002; Scholzen et al., 2002; Van Hooser et al., 2005), helping to partition the nucleolar components (Dundr et al., 2000; Van Hooser et al., 2005), and serving as a platform during nucleolar reassembly (Savino et al., 2001; Hernandez-Verdun, 2011). All of these hypotheses remained purely speculative, however, as no technique was available to perturb the formation of this layer. HeLa Kyoto and MRC5 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% and 15% FBS respectively. DT40 cells carrying a single integration of the LacO array (Vagnarelli et al., 2006) were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% chicken serum.
When the nucleolus disassembles during open mitosis, many nucleolar proteins and RNAs associate with chromosomes, establishing a perichromosomal compartment coating the chromosome periphery. At present nothing is known about the function of this poorly characterised compartment. In this study, we report that the nucleolar protein Ki-67 is required for the assembly of the perichromosomal compartment in human cells. Ki-67 is a cell-cycle regulated protein phosphatase 1-binding protein that is involved in phospho-regulation of the nucleolar protein B23/nucleophosmin. Following siRNA depletion of Ki-67, NIFK, B23, nucleolin, and four novel chromosome periphery proteins all fail to associate with the periphery of human chromosomes. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) images suggest a near-complete loss of the entire perichromosomal compartment. Mitotic chromosome condensation and intrinsic structure appear normal in the absence of the perichromosomal compartment but significant differences in nucleolar reassembly and nuclear organisation are observed in post-mitotic cells.
The genetic information of an organism is found in the nucleus of each cell in the form of DNA organised into chromosomes. The exact structure of those chromosomes changes as the cell moves through the different stages of the cell division cycle. During the stage called mitosis, where the DNA of a cell (which has previously been duplicated) is shared into two daughter cells, the chromosomes become tightly packed structures that can be readily moved through the cytoplasm. Since the late nineteenth century, it has been known that a layer of proteins, called the perichromosomal layer, coats the condensed chromosomes. However, virtually nothing was known about the role this layer performs.
