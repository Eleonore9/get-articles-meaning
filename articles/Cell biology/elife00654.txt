 Cells have evolved elaborate protein quality control mechanisms that assist proteins in achieving their desired native structure and also help target the degradation of proteins that have become misfolded, damaged, or otherwise aberrant. This system, often referred to as the cellular proteostasis network, consists of an elaborate network of proteins dedicated to preventing the toxic accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Newly translated proteins interact with chaperones that direct their folding into the native active form. Proteins that do not fold correctly or older proteins that exceed their functional lifetime are recognized by cellular quality control mechanisms that target them for degradation. Often, the cell employs compartment-specific mechanisms that ensure protein quality control. For example, misfolded protein domains that are soluble and accessible to the cytosol can be targeted for degradation by CHIP, an E3 ligase that interacts with various chaperones to target ubiquitination of misfolded substrates (Meacham et al., 2001). Similarly, unfolded soluble protein domains in the lumen of the ER are clients of the Hsp70 family member BiP/Kar2, and extended association with BiP/Kar2 can lead to targeting for ubiquitination by the ERAD machinery and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Claessen et al., 2011; Walter and Ron, 2011). In these examples, targeting of misfolded proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation is mediated by prolonged interaction with chaperones, which serve as adaptors that recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to modify misfolded clients. In both cases, ubiquitinated substrates are ultimately degraded by the proteasome. Previously, we found that certain environmental changes elicit highly-specific surface remodeling programs, such as the methionine-induced endocytic down-regulation of the methionine transporter Mup1 (Lin et al., 2008). In contrast, other environmental changes can stimulate global surface remodeling programs, such as the TORC1-mediated tuning of PM protein composition by activation of the ART adaptor network (MacGurn et al., 2011). Given the well-characterized effect of high temperature on protein denaturation, we reasoned that the conformational flux facilitated by heat stress might trigger partial denaturation or misfolding of integral membrane proteins, providing a simple assay for the investigation of PM quality control mechanisms. To characterize the effect of heat stress on integral PM protein stability in yeast, we analyzed the trafficking and degradation of various PM cargoes in cells grown at 26°C and shifted to 38°C for 60 min. In general, most cargoes were observed to undergo endocytosis followed by vacuolar trafficking (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2) and degradation (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplements 3-5), although a few cargoes appeared to be stable (Pdr5, Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 5) or induced during heat stress (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). This heat-induced endocytic downregulation was observed with varying kinetics and efficiency for many diverse cargoes including amino acid transporters (Mup1, Lyp1, Dip5), hexose transporters (Hxt3), G-protein coupled receptors (Ste3) and proton pumps (Pma1) (Figure 1B). Similar to heat stress, we found that other known proteotoxic stresses (growth in 10% ethanol, 5 mM DTT, or 2.5 mM diamide) triggered the endocytosis and vacuolar trafficking of different PM cargoes, suggesting that endocytic clearance may be associated with protein damage or misfolding. For example, ethanol stress triggered the endocytic downregulation of the arginine transporter Can1 and the methionine transporter Mup1, but had little effect on the surface stability of Lyp1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). In contrast, oxidative stress triggered the endocytic downregulation of Lyp1 and Can1 but had little effect on the surface stability of Mup1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). Given its dramatic affect on surface protein stability, and given the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to tolerate a wide range of temperatures for growth (Steinmetz et al., 2002), we decided to further investigate the molecular basis for heat-induced endocytic downregulation.10.7554/eLife.00459.003Figure 1.Heat stress triggers endocytic downregulation.(A) Fluorescence distribution of GFP-tagged endocytic cargoes (green) was analyzed in wildtype yeast cells expressing the vacuolar marker Vph1-mCherry (red). Cells were grown to mid-log phase at 26°C (left panels) and then shifted to 38°C for 2 hr (right panels). Plasma membrane (‘PM’) and vacuole (‘vac’) localization are indicated. Note that the GFP moiety of cargo fusions resists hydrolysis and thus fluorescence signal accumulates in the vacuole even as the protein appears to be degraded as monitored by immunoblot.

The critical balance between synthesis and turnover is particularly important in very long-lived post-mitotic cells like neurons, where cellular proteostasis must be maintained over the entire lifetime of the organism. Thus, protein quality and quantity in all cellular compartments must be carefully managed both as a critical housekeeping function and to protect cellular integrity during proteotoxic stress. Protein quality control systems share several key features that define their function as mediators of cellular proteostasis. Such systems generally (i) have the ability to selectively recognize damaged or misfolded proteins, (ii) target a broad array of misfolded substrates for refolding or degradation, (iii) undergo induction or activation in response to proteotoxic stress, and (iv) protect cells from possible cell death in the presence of proteotoxic stresses. Based on these four criteria, we propose that the ART-Rsp5 adaptor network comprises a new protein quality control (PMQC) system that functions primarily in the recognition and targeted removal of misfolded integral membrane proteins at the PM. Yeast cells expressing fluorescent fusion proteins were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic media. Microscopy was performed using a fluorescence microscope (DeltaVison RT; Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) equipped with FITC and rhodamine filters. Images were captured with a digital camera (Cool Snap HQ; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and deconvolved using softWoRx 3.5.0 software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA).
Secretory cargo that cannot fold properly in the ER are selectively targeted for removal by a well-studied ER-associated degradation pathway, or ERAD. In contrast, very little is known about post-ER quality control mechanisms for damaged or misfolded integral membrane proteins. Here we describe a quality control function of the Rsp5-ART ubiquitin ligase adaptor network that functions to protect plasma membrane (PM) integrity. Failure to mediate this protective response during heat stress leads to toxic accumulation of misfolded integral membrane proteins at the cell surface, which causes loss of PM integrity and cell death. Thus, the Rsp5-ART network comprises a PM quality control system that works together with sequential quality control pathways in the ER and Golgi to (i) target the degradation of proteins that have exceeded their functional lifetime due to damage and/or misfolding and (ii) limit the toxic accumulation of specific proteins at the cell surface during proteotoxic stress.
Cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms for the detection of misfolded or damaged proteins, and for targeting their degradation. Since the accumulation of misfolded proteins is toxic to the cell, these protein quality control systems are critical for the maintenance of normal cellular function over the lifetime of an organism. The breakdown of this quality control correlates with the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Normal function of the protein quality control machinery can also cause disease: this is the case with channelopathies such as cystic fibrosis, in which mutant ion channels are targeted for degradation and therefore cannot function correctly at the cell surface. Understanding how protein quality control systems recognize misfolded proteins and target their degradation, and designing ways to stabilize or destabilize specific targets, particularly at the cell surface, could thus lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
