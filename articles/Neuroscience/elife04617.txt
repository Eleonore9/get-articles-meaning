 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus is the primary regulator of daily rhythms of behavior and physiology in mammals (Meijer and Rietveld, 1989; Ralph et al., 1990; Sujino et al., 2003; Welsh et al., 2010), yet the majority of tissues in the body possess autonomous cellular oscillators (Yamazaki et al., 2000; Abe et al., 2002; Nagoshi et al., 2004; Welsh et al., 2004; Yoo et al., 2004; Abraham et al., 2005). The circadian clock in the SCN as well as in other mammalian cells is composed of interacting positive- and negative-transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops involving Clock and Bmal1 transcription factors and their target genes, Period (Per1, 2, and 3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and 2) (King et al., 1997; Gekakis et al., 1998; Hogenesch et al., 1998; Kume et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2001; Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004, 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Mohawk et al., 2012). Extensive evidence suggests that the SCN controls not only behavioral rhythms but also the circadian programs of peripheral tissues (Yoo et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2005, 2006; Saini et al., 2013; Yamaguchi et al., 2013). However, much remains unclear regarding the relationship between the central clock and peripheral oscillators, which can be entrained by many different stimuli (Stokkan et al., 2001; Buhr et al., 2010; Saini et al., 2012). To clarify the contribution of a central clock to the circadian rhythms of peripheral tissues, we sought to find a way to disable the molecular oscillators in the brain without affecting the genetic components in the rest of the body. Bmal1 (also known as Arntl, Mop3) is one of the essential components of the molecular oscillator, unique in that the single knockout of Bmal1 can confer arrhythmicity both at the behavioral and molecular levels (Bunger et al., 2000). To generate a forebrain-specific knockout of circadian rhythms, we crossed floxed Bmal1 (Bmal1fx/fx) mice (Johnson et al., 2014) to Camk2a::iCreBAC mice (CamiCre or Cre) (Casanova et al., 2001) and produced CamiCre+; Bmal1fx/fx (that we denote as ‘Brain’ Knockout, BKO, defined as a forebrain-specific knockout) as well as Bmal1fx/fx (Fx/Fx), CamiCre+ (Cre), and CamiCre+; Bmal1fx/+ (Het) control mice. Camk2a::iCreBAC mice were used because their Cre expression is faithful to the endogenous Camk2a gene expression pattern: it is neuron-specific, forebrain-enriched (Casanova et al., 2001), and expressed highly in the SCN as observed in Cre-dependent fluorescence reporter mice, CamiCre+; tdTom+ (Figure 1A-E). Although there are more than 37 different Camk2a::Cre transgenic lines reported in Mouse Genome Informatics database (http://www.informatics.jax.org/searchtool/Search.do?query=Camk2a-cre&page=featureList), the majority do not appear to express well in the SCN (e.g., http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/experiment/81162458), likely because of shorter promoter regulatory sequences and position effects. The other advantage of this Cre driver is that its Cre expression is post-natal and starts at P3 (Casanova et al., 2001), thus reducing potential developmental effects. Bmal1fx/fx mice were generated by inserting loxP sites into the introns surrounding exon 4, which codes for the DNA-binding bHLH domain (Johnson et al., 2014). Upon Cre recombination, exon 4 is deleted in BKO brain tissues that express Camk2a::iCre. The predicted BMAL1 sequence encounters a STOP codon after a stretch of 18 non-native residues following native coding exon 3. The resulting protein is 91 amino acids long (vs 626 amino acids of native BMAL1) and is almost identical to the truncated BMAL1 protein of Bmal1−/− mice (Bunger et al., 2000); both proteins contain no known functional domains and do not accumulate to a detectable level.10.7554/eLife.04617.003Figure 1.CamiCre+; Bmal1fx/fx mice are forebrain/SCN-specific Bmal1 knockouts.(A) Dorsal view of a CamiCre-; tdTom+ control brain.

Numbers of male mice weighed at 2 months (= 54- to 62-day old) and 4-6 months (= 120- to 195-day old), respectively: Cre (n = 25, 35), Het (n = 13, 15), Fx/Fx (n = 98, 37), and BKO (n = 55, 12). Numbers of female mice weighed at 2 months and 4-6 months, respectively: Cre (n = 28, 39), Het (n = 23, 35), Fx/Fx (n = 84, 54), and BKO (n = 54, 29). Shown are the mean weight ±SD. A significant effect of genotype was found using GLM ANOVA, followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison post-tests. The difference between Cre and Fx/Fx mice (*p ≤ 0.05) is likely due to the difference in the genetic background (CamiCre+ is generated in FVB background and floxed Bmal1 in 129sv). Importantly, there was no significant difference between BKO males and control males at 4-6 months, and BKO females did not weigh less than any control group at either time point.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04617.00410.7554/eLife.04617.005Figure 1—figure supplement 2.Additional in situ analysis of Bmal1 brain knockout mice.(A, B) Coronal brain sections at the level of the SCN.

(C) Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison post-tests (**p ≤ 0.05) showed that BKO mice had significantly lower Bmal1 mRNA levels than all three control groups at both CT6 and CT18. At both time points Het mice had significantly less Bmal1 mRNA than the other two controls but more mRNA than BKOs (*p ≤ 0.05). (D) BKO mice had significantly lower levels of Per2 mRNA than all three control groups at CT10 but not at CT22 (*p ≤ 0.05).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04617.005 Bmal1 is the only component of the mammalian circadian clock whose sole deletion generates a complete loss of circadian rhythms in mice (Bunger et al., 2000). Therefore, elimination of Bmal1 from a target tissue provides an invaluable model to study the behavioral and physiological consequences of abolishing circadian rhythms in a tissue-specific manner. In this study, we succeeded in removing Bmal1 specifically from the forebrain using a Camk2a::iCreBAC line (Casanova et al., 2001). Notably, this CamiCre driver was able to efficiently recombine and delete our target floxed gene in the entire SCN. These forebrain/SCN-specific Bmal1 knockouts exhibited a total loss of circadian behavioral rhythmicity, and their circadian phenotype in DD and LL is similar to that of global Bmal1 knockouts (Bunger et al., 2000). Thus, Bmal1 in the forebrain is essential for normal circadian activity rhythms. However, a Cre driver that can express more specifically in the SCN would be necessary to confirm the dominance of the SCN over other sites of the brain. All mice were housed under LD 12:12 unless otherwise noted. Camk2a::iCreBAC mice (CamiCre) (MGI:2181426) were kindly provided by Dr G. Schutz (Casanova et al., 2001). For a Cre reporter mouse, Rosa26-CAG-LSL-tdTomato (Ai14, kindly provided by Dr Hongkui Zeng) was used (Madisen et al., 2010). Bmal1fx/fx mice (Johnson et al., 2014) are homozygous for a Bmal1 allele which has loxP sites inserted into the introns surrounding exon 4. Bmal1fx/fx mice (129SvJ × C57BL/6J N3 backcross) were crossed to CamiCre to produce Bmal1fx/fx (Fx/Fx), CamiCre+;Bmal1fx/+ (Het) , and CamiCre+; Bmal1fx/fx (BKO) mice. CamiCre mice were mated to their siblings (FVB/N × C57BL/6J N3 backcross) to generate CamiCre hemizygous controls. Bmal1−/− global knockout mice (Bunger et al., 2000) were 129SvJ × C57BL/6J N14 backcross congenic animals. For the real-time reporting assay, PER2::LUC mice (Yoo et al., 2004) were crossed to Bmal1fx/fx to produce CamiCre+; Bmal1fx/fx; Per2Luc/+ and its control littermate, Bmal1fx/fx; Per2Luc/+. For the bioluminescence imaging experiments, Per2Luc mice were homozygous. For all experiments, male and female mice were used in balanced ratios; mice were 2-7 months old for behavior experiments and 3-11 months old for bioluminescence recordings and age-matched across groups, except for FR (males only were used for behavior experiments), where mice were 1.9-3.6 months old at the start of the experiment. All animal studies and Materials and methods were in accordance with Northwestern University and UT Southwestern Medical Center guidelines for animal care and use.
In order to assess the contribution of a central clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to circadian behavior and the organization of peripheral clocks, we generated forebrain/SCN-specific Bmal1 knockout mice by using floxed Bmal1 and pan-neuronal Cre lines. The forebrain knockout mice showed >90% deletion of BMAL1 in the SCN and exhibited an immediate and complete loss of circadian behavior in constant conditions. Circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues persisted but became desynchronized and damped in constant darkness. The loss of synchrony was rescued by light/dark cycles and partially by restricted feeding (only in the liver and kidney but not in the other tissues) in a distinct manner. These results suggest that the forebrain/SCN is essential for internal temporal order of robust circadian programs in peripheral clocks, and that individual peripheral clocks are affected differently by light and feeding in the absence of a functional oscillator in the forebrain.
Jet lag is a common experience when flying long distance. This disorientating phenomenon occurs when our internal ‘body clock’ remains set to the time zone where the plane departed and fails to reset to the new local time.
