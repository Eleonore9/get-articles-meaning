 The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are thought to play an important role in an extended hippocampal network central to memory formation (encoding) and novelty processing, which coordinates synaptic changes involving widespread neocortical areas, enabling life events to be recorded and later reinstated (Knight, 1996; Aggleton et al., 2010; Nyhus and Curran, 2011; Ritchey et al., 2013; Schott et al., 2013). While corticothalamic interactions are well-known to be crucial for adaptive behavior (Saalmann et al., 2012), the functional role of the ATN in humans has resisted investigation with non-invasive techniques owing both to its depth and small size. Here we had the rare opportunity to record electrophysiological activity during memory encoding directly from the ATN and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei (DMTN) of eight epileptic human volunteers with electrodes implanted for epilepsy treatment, as well as from frontal (and in two cases, parietal) scalp electrodes, reflecting neocortical activity (Figure 1). The DMTN are thought to be involved in executive control during memory retrieval (Van der Werf et al., 2003) and were hypothesized to play a lesser role than the ATN during encoding.10.7554/eLife.05352.003Figure 1.Intracranial electrode location in Participant 1.Left: Reconstruction of intrathalamic contact location using intraoperative X-ray image coordinates, superimposed on preoperative MRI scan.

Please refer to the original.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05352.003 We assessed the role of the ATN in memory encoding by contrasting electrophysiological activity during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding of serially presented photographs of 200 complex indoor and outdoor scenes. Participants judged whether each photograph depicted an indoor or an outdoor scene. Successful encoding was defined as correct recognition of a scene as old on a subsequent recognition memory test combining photographs of old and similar new scenes. All eight participants were able to discriminate old from new scenes (Table 1). Mean successful encoding across participants was 55%, and mean unsuccessful encoding was 45%, resulting in means of 101 and 87 observations per category, respectively, for EEG analysis.10.7554/eLife.05352.004Table 1.Behavioral resultsDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05352.004PtSE % (NE)SE-C %UE % (NE)FA % (NE)FA-C%CR % (NE)SE-FA %SE-C-FA-C %174 (74)7426 (26)29 (29)2571 (71)4549266 (132)39.534 (68)36 (72)6.564 (128)3033342.5 (85)35.557.5 (115)5 (10)1.595 (190)37.534436.5 (73)27.563.5 (127)21 (42)6.579 (158)15.521557.5 (115)3842.5 (85)47 (94)13.553 (106)10.524.5638.5 (77)36.561.5 (123)10 (20)490 (180)28.532.5781.5 (163)75.518.5 (37)63 (126)28.537 (74)18.547843.5 (87)41.556.5 (113)25 (50)1075 (150)18.531.5Mean55 (101)4645 (87)29.511.970.525.534.1SD17.318.217.319.19.919.111.89.3Pt = Participant.

We demonstrate increased corticothalamic synchrony during successful memory encoding, recording directly from the two most memory-relevant thalamic nuclei (ATN and DMTN). Our amplitude-independent phase synchrony measurements (Lachaux et al., 1999) show that timing of post-stimulus ATN theta activity alone (see also Figure 2—figure supplement 8), and its relation to local ATN processing as indexed by gamma amplitudes, is critical in successful memory encoding, providing the first electrophysiological evidence concerning the role of ATN in human memory formation. The absence of neocortical-DMTN synchrony differences, together with their recent detection during verbal memory retrieval (Staudigl et al., 2012), fits with evidence suggesting ATN specialization for encoding (Harding et al., 2000; Van der Werf et al., 2003), and DMTN for retrieval (Harding et al., 2000; Van der Werf et al., 2003; Aggleton et al., 2010; Aggleton, 2012). RATN involvement is moreover consistent with the non-verbal scene stimuli employed (Maillard et al., 2011), and with evidence that left thalamus lesions produce more severe memory deficits for verbal than non-verbal material (Squire et al., 1989). The late theta synchrony is in accord with the timing of differences in ERPs (Schott et al., 2002) and post-stimulus MT theta power (Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014) during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding of episodic memories. While oscillations in the delta frequency range have recently been found to show a memory-related difference in the hippocampus (Watrous et al., 2011; Lega et al., 2014), we did not detect a significant difference between corticothalamic delta phase synchrony during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding. Intrathalamic data were recorded from 1.5 mm platinum-iridium electrodes implanted bilaterally (four contacts each) in the thalamus for stimulation therapy for multiple pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy in eight adult participants, all of whom were not suitable candidates for resective surgery. A minimum sample size was not set, because memory-dependent phase synchrony has been detected on an individual level in intracranial recordings (Fell and Axmacher, 2011; Staudigl et al., 2012) (see also Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplements 6-7). The final number of participants was determined by the number of patients available in the days just following implantation during the approximately 2 years of the relevant therapeutic program, and also willing to participate in the study. This sample size was considerably greater than that usually available for intracranial studies in humans (Canolty et al., 2006; Fitzgerald et al., 2013; Bonini et al., 2014), and in non-human primates (Saalmann et al., 2012). The mean age of the participants was 37.5 years (range 28-52 years, standard deviation 8.2 years), and four participants were female. Stimulation via intracranial electrodes did not occur during the data recording. The measurements were approved by the Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty of the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg (application number 0308), and all participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008. Consent to participate in our study, as well as for publication of results in an anonymized format, was obtained by the neurosurgeon at the same time as consent was obtained for the surgical procedure.
The anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) is thought to play an important role in a brain network involving the hippocampus and neocortex, which enables human memories to be formed. However, its small size and location deep within the brain have impeded direct investigation in humans with non-invasive techniques. Here we provide direct evidence for a functional role for the ATN in memory formation from rare simultaneous human intrathalamic and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from eight volunteering patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes implanted for the treatment of epilepsy, demonstrating real-time communication between neocortex and ATN during successful memory encoding. Neocortical-ATN theta oscillatory phase synchrony of local field potentials and neocortical-theta-to-ATN-gamma cross-frequency coupling during presentation of complex photographic scenes predicted later memory for the scenes, demonstrating a key role for the ATN in human memory encoding.
Memories, both the mundane and the significant, play an integral role in our daily lives. Scientists have long sought to establish exactly how our memories are formed; how does an experience, with its sights, sounds and feelings, become a mental representation stored within our brain?
