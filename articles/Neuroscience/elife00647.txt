 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is behaviorally characterized by cognitive declines such as memory loss (Carlesimo and Oscar-Berman, 1992; Salmon and Bondi, 2009), but pathologically defined by β-amyloid plaques and tau pathology including neurofibrillary tangles and tau-mediated neurodegeneration (Wenk, 2003; Ashe and Zahs, 2010). A current challenge is how to bridge between these two very different aspects of AD. Because memory deficits are necessarily produced by the memory-processing neural circuits in vivo (Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2010), a key step toward this challenge is to understand the functional alterations in the memory circuits, including the hippocampus (HP), of the living brain with ongoing pathogenesis. Both the β-amyloid and tau pathologies are likely involved in the memory loss (Chapman et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2001; Cacucci et al., 2008; Ashe and Zahs, 2010; Palop and Mucke, 2010). In particular, tau pathology and subsequent neurodegeneration play a key role in mediating the memory symptoms seen at a mature stage of AD (Ashe and Zahs, 2010). Currently, it is unknown how the mnemonic functions of HP are altered by tau pathology in vivo. We recorded a total of 497 CA1 neurons from eight Tau and six wildtype (WT) control mice, all at 7-9 months old (Table 1). Confirming previous studies (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005), there was massive neurodegeneration in Tau mice at this age and the thickness of the CA1 pyramidal layer in HP of Tau mice was on average only 48% of that of WT mice (Figure 1 and Table 1).10.7554/eLife.00647.003Table 1.Details of the recorded miceDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00647.003Animal nameGenotypeSexAge (m)Brain weight (g)CA1 thickness (µm)Cortex thickness (µm)NfNnAN1WTM8-9NA5680073AN4WTM8-90.35051790160AN18WTM7-80.33455760810AN19WTF7-80.324516904130AN20WTF7-80.392516901637AN21WTF8-90.328516903134AN10+/−M8-90.364NANA4233AN11+/−M7-80.356537601015AN12−/+F7-80.310508001218AN16−/+M8-90.332608001518AN5TauF8-90.192265801715AN13TauF8-90.226225801410AN14TauF8-90.236275802425AN15TauM8-90.214265801018AN22TauM7-8NA285502010AN23TauM7-80.19824550710AN24TauF7-80.232275501414AN25TauM7-80.22626NA2927Total333327Genotype: see ‘Materials and methods’. Age: age of the mouse in months when data were recorded. Brain weight: weight of the brain with the cerebellum and olfactory bulb removed. CA1 thickness: thickness of the pyramidal cell layer in the dorsal CA1 of HP; cortex thickness: thickness of the parietal cortex above the dorsal CA1; measurements were made in the coronal sections that contained the most dorsal point of CA1, about the section at Bregma -2.06 (Figure 48) of the Franklin and Paxinos mouse atlas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008). Nf/Nn: number of CA1 neurons recorded in the familiar/novel room. NA: number not available. Note the lower brain weight, the thinner CA1 pyramidal layer, and the thinner cortex in Tau mice.10.7554/eLife.00647.004Figure 1.Histological confirmation of recording sites and neurodegeneration in Tau mice.The images are cresyl violet stained coronal brain sections, showing (1) the recording sites at the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of HP and (2) the prominent cell loss in Tau mice, compared with WT mice and mice with other two control genotypes (+/− and −/+). One section per recorded mouse is shown. One +/− mouse was not available for sectioning (NA). The recorded side of the brain in one Tau mouse was damaged during sectioning (NA). Recording sites at CA1 in these two mice were identified by electrode depths and the presence of sharp-wave ripple complexes (Csicsvari et al., 2000). Scale bar applies to all sections. Arrows: recording sites. Note the smaller hippocampi and thinner CA1 pyramidal cell layers in Tau mice.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00647.004 We have examined the HP spatial memory code in a tauopathy mouse model, the transgenic rTg4510 mice. Our data show that CA1 neurons in the transgenic mice do not fire at specific locations, but still form robust firing sequences. These sequences are not anchored to precise locations of spatial trajectories and do not even distinguish between two very different spatial environments. The sequences seen on novel trajectories already exist in a prior session of free exploration in an open box. Therefore, CA1 firing sequences in the transgenic mice become so rigid that they no longer primarily respond to spatial environments or spatial experience, and therefore no longer capable of encoding spatial memories. The mouse colony was maintained by an activator and a responder mouse lines (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005). The activator, bred in a 129S6 background strain, carried the tTA transgene under the CaMKIIa promoter. The responder, bred in the FVB/N strain, carried a transgene encoding the human four-repeat tau with the P301L mutation (hTauP301L). The F1 offspring of the two mouse lines that carries both the hTauP301L and tTA transgenes (hTau+/tTA+, Tau mice) has been shown to overexpress the human tau in the forebrain and display age-dependent progression of tau pathology and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus (HP) and the cortex (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005). The animals used in this study were Tau mice, their wildtype (hTau−/tTA−, WT) littermates, and littermates with the other two control genotypes, hTau+/tTA− (+/−) and hTau−/tTA+ (−/+), all at 7-9 month old (Table 1). Both male and female animals were used.
Hippocampal neurons encode spatial memories by firing at specific locations. As the animal traverses a spatial trajectory, individual locations along the trajectory activate these neurons in a unique firing sequence, which yields a memory code representing the trajectory. How this type of memory code is altered in dementia-producing neurodegenerative disorders is unknown. Here we show that in transgenic rTg4510 mice, a model of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal neurons did not fire at specific locations, yet displayed robust firing sequences as animals run along familiar or novel trajectories. The sequences seen on the trajectories also appeared during free exploration of open spaces. The spatially dissociated firing sequences suggest that hippocampal neurons in the transgenic mice are not primarily driven by external space but by internally generated brain activities. We propose that tau pathology and/or neurodegeneration renders hippocampal circuits overwhelmed by internal information and therefore prevents them from encoding spatial memories.
Patients with Alzheimer's disease often forget where they have been or who they have just met. This happens because the neurons in those areas of the brain where memories are processed are dying. Indeed, by the time Alzheimer's disease has been diagnosed, many of the neurons in these regions have already died. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are then produced by the remaining neurons. However, the reasons why the remaining neurons cannot make new memories are unknown.
