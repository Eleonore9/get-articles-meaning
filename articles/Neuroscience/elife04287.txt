 In humans, mutations in genes encoding synaptic organizing complexes have been implicated in numerous and diverse neurological diseases, ranging from congenital myasthenia to autism spectrum disorders (Sudhof, 2008; Burden et al., 2013). Lrp4 plays a key role in the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular synapses, as a loss of Lrp4 leads to a failure to form neuromuscular synapses, and mutations in Lrp4 or auto-antibodies to Lrp4 cause congenital myasthenia and myasthenia gravis, respectively (Shen et al., 2013; Ohkawara et al., 2014; Tsivgoulis et al., 2014). Lrp4 functions bidirectionally at neuromuscular synapses, where it responds to neuronal Agrin, stimulating MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that functions as a master regulator of synapse formation, and functions in a retrograde manner to stimulate differentiation of motor nerve terminals (Yumoto et al., 2012). Newborn mice, which lack Lrp4 in all tissues except skeletal muscle (Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m), retained the fused digit and appendage defects found in Lrp4 mutant mice. In other respects, the rescued mice appeared indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates (Figure 1A, inset). By three weeks after birth the growth rate of Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice began to slow and by 6 weeks the mice were modestly runted (Figure 1B). Nonetheless, Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice were fertile and lived a normal lifespan, indicating that Lrp4 is not required in tissues other than muscle for postnatal survival. The macroscopic morphology of the brain from adult Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice appeared normal, although brain size, like body mass, was modestly reduced (Figure 1C,D).10.7554/eLife.04287.003Figure 1.Restoring Lrp4 expression selectively in muscle of Lrp4 mutant mice rescues neonatal lethality.(A) Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice are fertile and live a normal lifespan. (B) The body mass of six-week old Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice is reduced by 16% (wild-type, 21.4 ± 0.8 g, n = 10; Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m, 18.0 ± 0.5 g, n = 5). (C) The gross morphology of the adult brain is similar in wild-type and Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice. (D) The size of the adult brain is reduced by 11% in Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice (wild-type, 0.45 ± 0.005 g, n = 17; Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m, 0.4 ± 0.008 g, n = 15). (E, F, G) The locomotor activity of Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice in an open field test was normal as measured by distance traveled (E), mean velocity (F), and maximum velocity (G) (wild-type, n = 17; Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m, n = 15). (H) Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m mice showed reduced exploratory behavior (wild-type, 22.3 ± 2.2%, n = 29; Lrp4−/−; Lrp4m, 14.9 ± 1.2%, n = 25).

Specifically, our results indicate that defects in synaptic transmission and postsynaptic integration may contribute to deficits in long-term plasticity, learning, and memory. Stimulation of CA3 inputs fails to induce LTP in Lrp4−/− CA1 neurons. Importantly, direct depolarization of Lrp4−/− CA1 neurons during TBS can rescue LTP. Thus, CA3-CA1 synapses in Lrp4 mutant neurons have the capacity to express LTP. Because direct stimulation by-passes the normal synaptic mechanisms for depolarizing CA1 neurons, the absence of LTP in Lrp4−/− CA1 neurons may be due to a failure of SC inputs to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons and remove the Mg++-dependent block of NMDA receptors. The reduction in the number of CA3-CA1 synapses on apical dendrites is consistent with this view. Mice that are null for Lrp4, or carry muscle-specific::Lrp4 (Lrp4m) or Thy1::YFP-H transgenes, have been described previously (Feng et al., 2000; Weatherbee et al., 2006; Gomez and Burden, 2011). Procedures were approved by the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol 140406-01).
Lrp4, the muscle receptor for neuronal Agrin, is expressed in the hippocampus and areas involved in cognition. The function of Lrp4 in the brain, however, is unknown, as Lrp4−/− mice fail to form neuromuscular synapses and die at birth. Lrp4−/− mice, rescued for Lrp4 expression selectively in muscle, survive into adulthood and showed profound deficits in cognitive tasks that assess learning and memory. To learn whether synapses form and function aberrantly, we used electrophysiological and anatomical methods to study hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. In the absence of Lrp4, the organization of the hippocampus appeared normal, but the frequency of spontaneous release events and spine density on primary apical dendrites were reduced. CA3 input was unable to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons to induce long-term potentiation. Our studies demonstrate a role for Lrp4 in hippocampal function and suggest that patients with mutations in Lrp4 or auto-antibodies to Lrp4 should be evaluated for neurological deficits.
LRP4 is a muscle protein that is found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that controls cognitive processes such as learning and memory. However, we know very little about what exactly LRP4 does in the hippocampus, and how it affects learning and memory.
