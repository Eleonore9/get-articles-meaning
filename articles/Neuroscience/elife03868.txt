 Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep plays a role in promoting the consolidation of memory (Stickgold, 2005; Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Mednick et al., 2011; Abel et al., 2013; Rasch and Born, 2013). Sleep deprivation following an associative learning task impairs consolidated memory in Drosophila, rodents, and humans whereas sleep immediately after a learning task actually improves consolidated memory across the same broad range of organisms (Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006; Donlea et al., 2011; Rasch and Born, 2013; Diekelmann, 2014). It is not, however, clear exactly how sleep promotes memory consolidation: it may simply be a permissive state generated by other brain regions that prevents sensory interference with memory circuits, or alternatively the memory circuitry itself may actively participate in sleep promotion as an integral aspect of the consolidation process. To begin to probe these issues, we have investigated the role of the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, which are critical to memory consolidation in Drosophila melanogaster, in the regulation of sleep. In order to determine whether DPMs play a role in regulating sleep, we acutely activated these neurons by driving the warmth-sensitive cation channel, dTrpA1 (Hamada et al., 2008) with NP2721-GAL4, a driver with relatively specific and strong DPM expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). A temperature shift at ZT0 from 22°C, a temperature at which dTrpA1 is inactive, to 31°C, where it is open and can depolarize DPMs, produced an immediate and dramatic increase in sleep (Figure 1A). dTrpA1 activation with a weaker, but even more specific DPM driver line, VT64246-GAL4, also resulted in immediate and significant increases in sleep (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,C) indicating the effect is due to activation of DPM neurons and not other neurons in the NP2721-GAL4 expression pattern. Activating DPMs with dTrpA1 did not alter the level of locomotor activity during waking periods (light period of first day: PGAL4 = 0.57, PUAS<0.0001 and for the dark period of first day: PGAL4 = 0.5, PUAS = 0.13), suggesting that this treatment does not cause locomotor impairment. Additionally, video recordings at 0-2 min and >2 hr after DPM activation at 31–32°C show that flies are immediately arousable by gentle tapping and have normal geotaxis and locomotion, consistent with DPM activation inducing a sleep state rather than paralysis or locomotor dysfunction (Video 1).10.7554/eLife.03868.003Figure 1.DPM activity and synaptic release are sleep promoting in a cell-autonomous manner.(A) Flies exhibit large gains in sleep when DPM neurons are activated with dTrpA1 at 31°C (w-; NP2721-GAL4/ UAS-dTrpA1-II). Compensatory sleep loss is apparent during recovery following 2 days of dTrpA1 activation. (B1) Flies show small but significant sleep loss when DPM synaptic release is inhibited with Shits after shift to 31°C (w-; NP2721-GAL4; 20xUAS-IVS-Syn21-Shits). Continuing sleep loss is apparent during the first 12 hr of recovery following Shits inhibition of DPM synaptic release. (B2) Sleep loss can be seen over multiple cycles of temperature shift when DPM synaptic release is inhibited with Shits (w-; NP2721-GAL4; 20xUAS-IVS-Syn21-Shits). For quantification in B2, day 1 was used as a baseline to calculate day 2 sleep changes and day 3 was used as a baseline to calculate day 4 sleep changes. (C) Sleep gains resulting from dTrpA1 activation are fully blocked when DPM synaptic release is inhibited with Shits at 31°C (w-; NP2721-GAL4/ UAS-dTrpA1-II; 20xUAS-Tts-Shits). Left plots show sleep in 30-min bins during a baseline day (22°C for dTrpA1 alone, 18°C for Shits or combined UAS experiments), followed by 1–2 days of DPM hyperactivation or inhibition (31°C) and 1 day of recovery (22°C for dTrpA1 alone, 18°C for Shits or combined UAS experiments). Right plots show a quantification of the 30-min data in 12-hr bins across 1 or 2 days of heating and 1 day of recovery. Sleep change is quantified as the minutes of sleep gained or lost by the experimental genotype in comparison to either the UAS or GAL4 control genotypes during heating and recovery periods. Grey shading indicates the dark period/night, red bars indicate increased temperature. All data are presented as mean plus-minus SEM where * represents p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, and ***p < 0.0001 using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Asterisks denote DPM cell bodies and brain regions with ectopic GAL4 expression are labeled. Bottom: Relative DPM expression strength, relative degree of non-DPM expression, other brain regions with GAL4 expression and a list of experiments in which each GAL4 line was used. Ectopic expression amongst the three GAL4 lines appears to be non-overlapping, suggesting DPMs are the only common locus of expression in these lines. Although addition of ey-GAL80 greatly reduces background expression of the c316-GAL4 insertion, these flies were less healthy than other lines and thus were only used for functional imaging, but not generally for behavior experiments. Addition of the MB-GAL80 transgene was also necessary in the ey-GAL80;; c316-GAL4 line to suppress a low level of GAL4 expression in MB Kenyon cells (the brain shown above does not contain MB-GAL80).

Flies with DPM driven dTrpA1 expression show normal locomotion when gently tapped (0:00:01), but quickly assume a stationary resting position after ∼30 s undisturbed (0:00:35), whereas control flies remain awake and continue to explore the environment. All flies were anesthetized with CO2, counted, and sorted into groups of ten 1 day prior to video recording and kept on food at 22°C prior to heating. Flies were heated at 31°C on food for 2 hr and flipped to empty vials just prior to recording.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03868.008 The inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, is known to promote sleep in both mammals (Rasch and Born, 2013) and Drosophila (Agosto et al., 2008), but specific sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons have not been identified in the fly. Additionally, it is known that sleep promotes memory consolidation in Drosophila (Donlea et al., 2011) and other animals (Rasch and Born, 2013; Diekelmann, 2014), but it is unclear how sleep and memory circuits interact to facilitate memory consolidation. Here we find a shared anatomical locus of memory consolidation and GABAergic sleep-promotion in the DPM neurons. We show that α’/β’ neurons, postsynaptic targets of the GABAergic DPM processes, are wake-promoting. The specific involvement of neurons required for memory consolidation (and their memory-relevant post-synaptic targets) in the regulation of sleep suggests that generation of sleep by activation of learning circuits is an intrinsic property of the circuit, not an extrinsically imposed phenomenon. Further, our finding that the memory-consolidation specific DPM neurons are inhibitory suggests that inhibitory neurotransmitters may play an as-of-yet uncharacterized role in memory consolidation in Drosophila. Fly stocks were raised on modified Brent and Oster cornmeal-dextrose-yeast agar media (Brent et al., 1974) Per batch: 60 l H2O, 600 g Agar, 1950 g flaked yeast, 1451 g cornmeal, 6300 g dextrose, 480 g NaKT, 60 g CaCl2, 169 g Lexgard dissolved in ethanol. Flies were raised under a 12:12 light:dark cycle at 25°C except for animals carrying UAS-dTrpA1 which were raised at 22°C or flies carrying either pTub-GAL80ts or UAS-IVS-Syn21-Shits which were raised at 18°C.

The following RNAi lines have been functionally verified previously: Rdl-RNAi (Liu et al., 2007), GABABR3-RNAi (Dahdal et al., 2010).
Sleep promotes memory consolidation in humans and many other species, but the physiological and anatomical relationships between sleep and memory remain unclear. Here, we show the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, which are required for memory consolidation in Drosophila, are sleep-promoting inhibitory neurons. DPMs increase sleep via release of GABA onto wake-promoting mushroom body (MB) α'/β' neurons. Functional imaging demonstrates that DPM activation evokes robust increases in chloride in MB neurons, but is unable to cause detectable increases in calcium or cAMP. Downregulation of α'/β' GABAA and GABABR3 receptors results in sleep loss, suggesting these receptors are the sleep-relevant targets of DPM-mediated inhibition. Regulation of sleep by neurons necessary for consolidation suggests that these brain processes may be functionally interrelated via their shared anatomy. These findings have important implications for the mechanistic relationship between sleep and memory consolidation, arguing for a significant role of inhibitory neurotransmission in regulating these processes.
Sleep affects memory: if you do not sleep well after a learning task, chances are you will not be able to recall whatever you tried to learn earlier. This is seen in almost all animals ranging from the fruit fly Drosophila, to mice and humans. However, the precise details of how memory and sleep are connected remain unclear.
