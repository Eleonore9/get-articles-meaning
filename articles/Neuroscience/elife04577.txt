 Neural representations of the sensory world give rise to appropriate innate or learned behavioral responses. Innate behaviors are observed in naïve animals without prior learning or experience, suggesting that they are mediated by genetically determined neural circuits. Responses to most sensory stimuli, however, are not innate but experience-dependent, allowing an organism to respond appropriately in a variable and uncertain world. Thus, most sensory cues acquire behavioral relevance through learning. In Drosophila melanogaster, a number of different forms of learning have been observed in response to sensory stimuli (Siegel and Hall, 1979; Liu et al., 1999, 2006; Masek and Scott, 2010; Schnaitmann et al., 2010; Ofstad et al., 2011; Vogt et al., 2014). In associative olfactory learning, exposure to an odor (conditioned stimulus, CS) in association with an unconditioned stimulus (US) results in appetitive or aversive memory (Quinn et al., 1974; Tempel et al., 1983; Tully and Quinn, 1985). Olfactory memory formation and retrieval in insects require the mushroom body (MB) (Heisenberg et al., 1985; de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994, Dubnau et al., 2001; McGuire et al., 2001), an associative center in the protocerebrum (Figure 1 and Video 1).10.7554/eLife.04577.003Figure 1.Anatomy of olfactory pathways in the adult fly brain.(A) An image of the adult female brain showing the antennal lobes (AL) and subregions of the mushroom bodies (MB; see panel B for more detail). The image was generated using a 3D image rendering software (FluoRender) (Wan et al., 2009; Wan et al., 2012). The 51 glomeruli of the AL extend projection neurons (PN) to the calyx of the MB and the lateral horn (LH). There are a total of ∼200 PN; 6 from the DL3 glomerulus are shown. See Video 1 for an introduction to olfactory circuit. (B) Subregions within the MB. The γ lobe, calyx, and pedunculus (ped) are displayed separately from other lobes; their normal positions are as shown in panel A and Video 1. Color-coding is as in panel A. See below for a detailed description of dorsal accessory calyx (dAC) and ventral accessory calyx (vAC). (C) A schematic representation of the key cellular components and information flow during processing of olfactory inputs to the MB (see text for references and more details). Olfactory receptor neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge onto a single glomerulus in the AL. A small number (generally 3-4) of PNs from each of the 51 AL glomeruli innervate the MB calyx where they synapse on the dendrites of the ∼2000 Kenyon cells (KCs) in a globular structure, the calyx. Each KC exhibits, on average, 6.4 dendritic ‘claws’ (Butcher et al., 2012), and each claw is innervated by a single PN. There is little order in connection patterns of PNs to KCs. The axons of the KCs project in parallel anteriorly through the pedunculus to the lobes, where KCs terminate onto the dendrites of MB output neurons (MBONs). KCs can be categorized into three major classes α/β, α′/β′, and γ based on their projection patterns in the lobes (Crittenden et al., 1998). The β, β′, and γ lobes constitute the medial lobes (also known as horizontal lobes), while the α and α′ lobes constitute the vertical lobes. These lobes are separately wrapped by ensheathing glia (Awasaki et al., 2008). The α/β and α′/β′ neurons bifurcate at the anterior end of the pedunculus and project to both the medial and vertical lobes (Lee et al., 1999). The γ neurons project only to the medial lobe. Dendrites of MBONs and terminals of modulatory dopaminergic neurons (DANs) intersect the longitudinal axis of the KC axon bundle, forming 15 subdomains, five each in the α/β, α′/β′, and γ lobes (numbered α1, α2, and α3 for subdomains in the α lobe from proximal to distal) (Tanaka et al., 2008). Additionally, one MBON and one DAN innervate the core of the distal pedunculus intersecting the α/β KCs (pedc, see below). There are seven types of KCs; five of the seven types have their dendrites in the main calyx, while those of the γd cells form the vAC (Aso et al., 2009; Butcher et al., 2012) and those of the α/βp cells the dAC (Tanaka et al., 2008). The accessory calyces are thought to receive non-olfactory input since they do not receive input from the PNs from the AL (Tanaka et al., 2008). Different KCs occupy distinct layers in the lobes as indicated (p: posterior; c: core; s: surface; m: medial; a: anterior; and d: dorsal). Some MB extrinsic neurons extend processes to only a specific layer within a subdomain, defining elemental subdivisions in the lobes, or ‘synaptic units’ as proposed by Tanaka et al. (2008).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.00310.7554/eLife.04577.004Video 1.Introduction to MB anatomy and the olfactory circuit.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.004 We designed a genetic approach to examine the architecture of the MB circuit and identified most, if not all, of the neurons innervating the MB lobes. We screened adult brains from 7000 GAL4 lines driven by known enhancers (Pfeiffer et al., 2008; Jenett et al., 2012) to identify lines containing neurons that innervate the MB lobes. These GAL4 drivers typically label many other neurons, making it difficult to disambiguate the projection patterns of the labeled MB neurons. We therefore identified lines with overlapping expression patterns for the MB neurons and used the split-GAL4 strategy (Luan et al., 2006; Pfeiffer et al., 2010) to identify lines with more restricted expression in the MB (Figure 2). After screening 2500 such intersections, we obtained more than 400 split-GAL4 combinations that had strong expression in the MB neurons. Most split-GAL4 lines that drive expression in MBONs or DANs contain a small number of neurons that share virtually identical morphologies and exhibit bilateral symmetry, and this profile is maintained across different individuals (Figure 2—figure supplements 3-6 and data not shown). The split-GAL4 lines that label the KC contain far greater cell numbers (75-600) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These split-GAL4 lines allowed us to classify the MB neurons into cell types (Figure 3 and Videos 2-4). We operationally define a cell type as a single neuron (per hemisphere) or a group of neurons that is not further subdivided in any of the 7000 GAL4 lines. Moreover, neurons within most cell types exhibit indistinguishable morphology. Importantly, we identified on average 12 GAL4 drivers that label the same cell type within the set of 7000 lines, indicating that the screen was near saturation in our large GAL4 collection.10.7554/eLife.04577.005Figure 2.Generation of split-GAL4 drivers for the MB neurons.An example of the use of the split-GAL4 approach to generate a driver line specific for MBON-α′2 (see Table 1 for the naming convention of MBONs and DANs). R20G03-GAL4 in attP2 (left) and R19F09-GAL4 in attP2 (center) both show expression in MBON-α′2 when crossed to pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP in attP2 and in many other neurons that differ between the two GAL4 lines. The optic lobes (OL), central brain (CB), and ventral nerve cord (VNC) are indicated. The enhancer fragments from these lines were used to generate the fly line MB018B carrying both R20G03-p65ADZp in attP40 and R19F09-ZpGAL4DBD in attP2 (right). The p65ADZp and ZpGAL4DBD proteins are themselves inactive; the reconstitution of an active GAL4 transcription factor requires heterodimerization that occurs only in cells expressing both proteins (Luan et al., 2006; Pfeiffer et al., 2010). This approach, therefore, labels cells in which both enhancers are active. The arrow indicates the cell body of one MBON-α′2 cell visualized using pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG reporter in VK00005 (white). Neuropils were visualized with nc82 antibody (orange). Genotypes of 92 split-GAL4 lines and the cell types they label are listed in Supplementary file 1 and raw confocal images are available online (http://www.janelia.org/split-gal4). The expression pattern observed using a split-GAL4 line depends to some extent on the UAS reporter construct used, as illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Expression patterns of split-GAL4 lines for KCs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), PPL1-cluster DANs (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), PAM cluster DANs (Figure 2—figure supplement 4), and MBONs (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) are shown. We also generated split-GAL4 lines for a variety of other modulatory cell types that project to the MB including serotonergic, GABAergic, octopaminergic, and peptidergic neurons (Figure 2—figure supplement 6). We chose lines with minimal off-target expression in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 7) to facilitate the use of these lines in future functional analyses to manipulate the activity of individual cell types.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.00510.7554/eLife.04577.006Figure 2—figure supplement 1.Expression pattern of split-GAL4 drivers with various reporters.Expression pattern of the MB005B (A-D) or MB002B (E-I) visualized with different UAS-reporters, as indicated by the number in the top left corner of each panel: 1, pJFRC200-10XUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA in attP18; 2, pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP in VK00005; 3, pJFRC225-5XUAS-myr::smGFP-FLAG in VK00005; 4, 20xUAS-IVS-CsChrimson in attP18; 5, 20xUAS-IVS-CsChrimson in attP2. UAS expression was imaged by confocal microscopy and then rendered using FluoRender (white; see ‘Materials and methods’). For reference, the neuropil was visualized (orange) using an nc82 antibody. Reporters in attP18 tended to show weaker but more restricted labeling compared to those in attP2 or VK00005 (Pfeiffer et al., 2010). (A-D) The α′/β′ Kenyon cells were consistently visualized with the four reporters tested, although intensity of signals differed. Expression pattern was very specific to the α′/β′ Kenyon cells with pJFRC-10XUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA in attP18 (A), whereas other reporters visualized additional expression in off-target cell types (arrows in B and D). (E-I) MB002B consistently visualized the MBON-β′2mp with all five reporters tested. The two reporters in attP18 visualized only MBON-β′2mp (E and H; cell bodies are indicated by arrowheads). However, we detected additional expression in other MBONs (but no other cell types) with reporters in VK00005, which also visualized MBON-γ5β′2a (F and G), and in attP2, which also visualized MBON-γ5β′2a and MBON-β′2mp_bilateral (I). These cell types have similar cell body locations (arrowheads) and axon tracts, consistent with those arising from the same developmental lineage.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.00610.7554/eLife.04577.007Figure 2—figure supplement 2.Expression patterns of split-GAL4 drivers for KCs.(A-L) Expression patterns obtained with a UAS-reporter that showed high-specificity are shown; the number in the top right corner in each panel indicates the reporter (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

Such lines are not recommended for use in behavioral experiments but can be utilized for anatomical analyses; for example, MB062C is used in Figure 11D.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.01210.7554/eLife.04577.015Figure 3.MB cell types.Registered images of KCs (A; Video 2), MBONs (B; Video 3), and DANs (C; Video 4). After alignment to the standard brain and segmentation, different colors were assigned to each cell type, while the outlines of the neuropils of the brain are shown in light gray. These images illustrate the overall extent and position of these cell types in the brain; the morphology of individual cell types can be seen in Videos 2-4. For MBONs, the two neurons found upon PA-GFP tracing experiments (see below) are not included, thus the image represents 19 different MBON cell types. These are the three major intrinsic and extrinsic neuron types innervating the MB lobes. Additionally, there are two intrinsic neurons (MB-APL and MB-DPM) and 10 extrinsic neuron types that innervate the MB; see Table 1 for references. The extrinsic neurons with processes in the lobes include two types of octopaminergic neurons (OA-VPM3 and OA-VPM4) and one type of peptidergic neuron (SIFamide). The extrinsic neurons with processes in the calyx include two types of octopaminergic neurons (OA-VPM5 and OA-VUMa2), one type of GABAergic neuron (MB-C1), one serotonergic neuron (MB-CSD), two types of DANs (PPL2ab-DANs), and one neuron with dendritic arbors in the calyx and the proximal pedunculus as well as in the LH (MB-CP1). See Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for images of some of these cell types.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.01510.7554/eLife.04577.016Figure 3—figure supplement 1.MBON-calyx and other modulatory neurons.Each cell type was segmented and visualized using FluoRender. Oblique view (A-C) or frontal views (D-F) are shown. (A) A single MB-CP1 in MB622B was visualized with pJFRC225-5XUAS-myr::smGFP-FLAG in VK00005. The dendrites of this neuron are in the calyx, pedunculus, and the lateral horn (LH) and its terminals bilaterally project to the crepine (CRE). The neurotransmitter used by this neuron has not been determined. (B) A single MB-DPM in MB034C was visualized with pJFRC225-5XUAS-myr::smGFP-FLAG in VK00005. (C) A single MB-APL in VT43924 was visualized by multi-color flp-out (MCFO; see ‘Materials and methods’). (D) One of the two MB-C1 neurons in MB380B was visualized by MCFO. They were immunoreactive to GAD1 (data not shown). (E) OA-VPM3 and OA-VPM4 (four cells in total per brain) in MB022B were visualized with pJFRC200-10XUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA in attP18. (F) One of the four SIFamide neurons in MB013B was visualized by MCFO. In addition to the reported innervation of the calyx (Verleyen et al., 2004), we also found terminals in α3.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.01610.7554/eLife.04577.017Video 2.KCs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.01710.7554/eLife.04577.018Video 3.MBONs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.01810.7554/eLife.04577.019Video 4.PAM and PPL1 cluster DANs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.019 We have identified the neurons that comprise the MB and characterized their projection patterns. These data provide a comprehensive map describing the potential connections of neurons in the MB lobes. The MB lobes are innervated by approximately 2000 KCs, 34 MBONs of 21 cell types, and about 130 modulatory DANs of 20 cell types that fall into two families, PAM and PPL1. These data, extending the level of detail and completeness of previous studies of MB anatomy (Tanaka et al., 2008; Mao and Davis, 2009), describe the neuronal architecture of the MB and provide insight into the logic of MB function. Split-GAL4 and LexA transgenes used enhancers, selected based on GAL4-line expression patterns (Jenett et al., 2012), and were constructed as previously described (Pfeiffer et al., 2010). VT999036 was from the Vienna Tiles collection and a gift of Barry Dickson. Promoter regions corresponding to the following GAL4 constructs were amplified by PCR: TH-GAL4 (Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003), Ddc-GAL4 (Li et al., 2000), HL9-GAL4 (Claridge-Chang et al., 2009), and Tdc2-GAL4 (Cole et al., 2005). All fragments were amplified from genomic DNA except for the upstream region of HL9, which was amplified from the HL9-GAL4 plasmid in order to conserve the mutated exon B start site. 5′-XbaI and 3′-FseI sites were added to the fragments upstream of GAL4. Downstream fragments were amplified with added 5′-SpeI (TH) or NheI (Tdc2, Ddc and HL9) sites and 3′-NotI sites. These fragments were then cloned into the corresponding sites on pBPp65ADZpUw and pBPZpGAL4DBDUw vectors (Pfeiffer et al., 2010) that had been modified to add new restriction sites as follows: the p65ADZp and ZpGAL4DBD segments of these vectors were amplified with the addition of a 5′-XbaI and a 3′-AvrII site and then cloned into pBDP (Pfeiffer et al., 2008) at 5′-EcoRI and 3′-NotI. Downstream fragments were cloned into the modified AD and DBD vectors at AvrII NotI (TH) or NheI NotI (Tdc2, Ddc and HL9) sites. To generate Trh-p65ADZp and Trh-ZpGAL4DBD, the Trh promoter region was amplified from genomic DNA using primers SM(1A) and BI(1S) (Alekseyenko et al., 2010) and cloned into pBPp65ADZpw and pBPZpGAL4DBDw using the Gateway system as previously described (Pfeiffer et al., 2008, 2010).
We identified the neurons comprising the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), an associative center in invertebrate brains, and provide a comprehensive map describing their potential connections. Each of the 21 MB output neuron (MBON) types elaborates segregated dendritic arbors along the parallel axons of ∼2000 Kenyon cells, forming 15 compartments that collectively tile the MB lobes. MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB and three MBON types form a feedforward network in the lobes. Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one, or at most two, of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell-MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations. The elucidation of the complement of neurons of the MB provides a comprehensive anatomical substrate from which one can infer a functional logic of associative olfactory learning and memory.
One of the key goals of neuroscience is to understand how specific circuits of brain cells enable animals to respond optimally to the constantly changing world around them. Such processes are more easily studied in simpler brains, and the fruit fly—with its small size, short life cycle, and well-developed genetic toolkit—is widely used to study the genes and circuits that underlie learning and behavior.
