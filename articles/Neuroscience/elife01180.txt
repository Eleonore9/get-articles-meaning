 The molecular mechanism of how Ca2+ influx accelerates synaptic vesicle (SV) release remains at the heart of understanding synapse action in the normal brain and under disease conditions (Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012). In most synapses, SV release evoked by Ca2+ influx consists of a fast synchronous phase that occurs on a millisecond timescale and a slow asynchronous phase that occurs with some delay and persists for tens or hundreds of milliseconds. Additionally, all synapses manifest spontaneous release, corresponding to stochastic fusion of individual SVs. The key proteins mediating SV release include soluble Nethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, UNC-13/Munc13s, synaptotagmins and complexins (Wojcik and Brose, 2007; Südhof and Rothman, 2009). The unc-13 locus contains 31 exons, and produces a major long isoform UNC-13L of 1816 amino acid residues and a short isoform UNC-13S that lacks the N-terminal 607 amino acid residues of UNC-13L and has a different N-terminal domain, through the use of different promoters and alternative splicing (Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 2) (Kohn et al., 2000). We isolated the unc-13(n2609) mutation in a genetic screen for suppression of the convulsive behavior caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the neuronal acetylcholine receptor acr-2 (Jospin et al., 2009) (see ‘Materials and methods’ and below). unc-13(n2609) changes glutamine 46 to a stop codon within the C2A domain of UNC-13L (Figure 1A). The C2A domain shares 50% identity with rat Munc13-1 and 49% identity with rat ubMunc-13-2, respectively (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The key amino acids for homodimerization and for heterodimerization with RIM are conserved between C. elegans and mammals. Among previously reported mutations, unc-13(s69) is a null allele for the entire locus, and unc-13(e1091) is a null allele for the long isoform only (Figure 1A, Supplementary file 1A). Both unc-13(s69) and unc-13(e1091) mutants are severely paralyzed (Kohn et al., 2000) (Figure 1B). In contrast, unc-13(n2609) animals exhibited moderate slowing of locomotion (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 3). unc-13(n2609)/unc-13(s69) or unc-13(n2609)/unc-13(e1091) animals showed more movement impairment than did unc-13(n2609) homozygous mutants (data not shown). These observations indicate that unc-13(n2609) is a recessive partial loss of function mutation. Differential expression and function of UNC-13/Munc13 isoforms endow synapses with distinct release properties (Augustin et al., 2001; Rosenmund et al., 2002). Several recent studies have begun to unveil the function specificity mediated by the N-terminal domains in different Munc13 isoforms (Deng et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2013; Lipstein et al., 2013). The non-calcium binding C2A domain of UNC-13/Munc13 serves as protein interacting domain to bind itself or the active zone protein RIM (Betz et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2006). In this study, taking advantage of the unc-13(n2609) mutation as well as single-copy expression of UNC-13L variants in unc-13 null mutants, we have uncovered specific roles of the C2A domain in SV release probability and spontaneous release. The precise active zone localization depends on the C2A-containing N-terminal region unique to UNC-13L, and directly contributes to SV release kinetics. Our data support a conclusion that the proximity of UNC-13/Munc13 to the Ca2+ entry site plays a critical role in SV release probability and release kinetics, and also suggest that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may share a common pool of synaptic vesicles at the active zone. C. elegans strains were maintained on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates at room temperature (20-22°C) as described (Brenner, 1974). Double mutants were constructed following standard procedures, and genotypes were confirmed by allele-specific sequence polymorphism. Supplementary file 1A and 1B show the details for each mutation and strains; and Supplementary file 1C lists the genotypes of all transgenic strains.
The presynaptic active zone proteins UNC-13/Munc13s are essential for synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis by directly interacting with SV fusion apparatus. An open question is how their association with active zones, hence their position to Ca2+ entry sites, regulates SV release. The N-termini of major UNC-13/Munc13 isoforms contain a non-calcium binding C2A domain that mediates protein homo- or hetero-meric interactions. Here, we show that the C2A domain of Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-13 regulates release probability of evoked release and its precise active zone localization. Kinetics analysis of SV release supports that the proximity of UNC-13 to Ca2+ entry sites, mediated by the C2A-domain containing N-terminus, is critical for accelerating neurotransmitter release. Additionally, the C2A domain is specifically required for spontaneous release. These data reveal multiple roles of UNC-13 C2A domain, and suggest that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may involve a common pool of SVs at the active zone.
Neurons are connected to each other by junctions called synapses. When an electrical signal travelling along a neuron arrives at a synapse, it causes the release of bubble-like structures called synaptic vesicles that contain chemicals called neurotransmitters. When released by the vesicles these neurotransmitters bind to receptors on a second neuron and allow the signal to continue on its way through the nervous system.
