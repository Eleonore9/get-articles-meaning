 Studies of acoustic communication focus on the production of acoustic signals by males and the arbitration of mating decisions by females. However, for many species of primates (Haimoff, 1986), birds (Hall, 2004), frogs (Tobias et al., 1998), and insects (Bailey, 2003), females also produce songs, and duets are common; moreover, recent studies suggest that female song production may be ancestral (Wiens, 2001; Odom et al., 2014). Animal duets involve predictable response latencies between the calls of males and females; that is, males and females do not sing simultaneously, as human duetters do, but rather interchange acoustic signals (Bailey and Hammond, 2003). Duetting species can be grouped into two classes: those that answer their partner's song without fine-scale coordination of song syllables or elements (polyphonal duetters) and those that synchronize within a song bout (antiphonal duetters) (Hall, 2009). Regardless of duet type, each individual must adjust the rate and timing of his/her courtship songs relative to each other. Therefore, duetting requires speed and accuracy in both detection of a partner's signal and the production of a response. Latencies between male and female songs are reported to be as short as tens of milliseconds for some birds (Logue et al., 2008; Fortune et al., 2011) and insects (Heller and von Helversen, 1986; Rheinlaender et al., 1986). For example, the antiphonal duets of plain-tailed wrens are so rapid that they sound as if produced by a single animal (Mann et al., 2006). Both male and female wrens display differences in inter-syllable intervals when singing alone vs with a partner, indicating that sensory perception plays an ongoing role in shaping song timing (Fortune et al., 2011). In support of this, recordings from pre-motor areas of the wren brain (HVC) reveal auditory responses that are tuned to duets (Fortune et al., 2011); that is, neural centers that drive song production also directly integrate auditory information. For polyphonal duetting bushcrickets, which like many insects produce sounds via their wings, auditory information is transmitted not only to the brain but also directly to wing-controlling neural ganglia; thus, similar to birds, this suggests that song pattern-generating circuits (housed in these ganglia) directly integrate auditory information to shape duets (Rheinlaender et al., 1986). Previous studies have documented the presence of female song in the D. virilis group of species (Satokangas et al., 1994); however, it is not known if males and females coordinate their song production into duets nor have the mechanisms underlying female song production been studied. By combining video and audio recordings, we matched D. virilis male and female wing movements with acoustic signals to accurately classify male and female song (Figure 1A-C and Video 1). We recorded song in a multi-channel recording apparatus (Arthur et al., 2013). We chose virilis strain 15010-1051.47, because males and females of this strain sang robustly in our courtship chambers (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Consistent with previous reports (Huttunen et al., 2008), we found that virilis males (when paired with a virgin female) produce highly stereotyped bouts of pulses via unilateral wing vibration (Figure 1A,D). We define a bout as a stretch of song from either a male or female, which is separated from the next stretch of song by more than 150 ms. Each male bout contains 6.9 ± 1.2 pulses with an inter-pulse interval (IPI) of 21.2 ± 1.9 ms (Figure 1E). Females (when paired with a virgin male), in contrast, use bilateral wing vibration to generate variable-length bouts of pulses separated by longer (and more variable) IPIs (7.2 ± 6.2 pulses per bout, with IPIs of 55.2 ± 26.3 ms) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1E). The frequency spectra of individual male pulses show a peak at higher frequencies relative to individual female pulses (Figure 1F). Although there are instances of song overlap between males and females, this behavior is extremely rare (Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 3E [population median of overlaps = 0%]). Based on these characteristics, we modified our software for automated segmentation of D. melanogaster song (Arthur et al., 2013) to segment virilis male and female pulses (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).10.7554/eLife.07277.003Figure 1.Drosophila virilis males and females produce distinct courtship songs.Schematic of the wing movement during the production of courtship song in Drosophila virilis male (A) and female (B).

This is significant because, as a Drosophilid, virilis shares developmental similarities with melanogaster (Kuntz and Eisen, 2014) and in addition has had its genome fully sequenced and annotated (Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007). This makes feasible the development of genetic (Bassett and Liu, 2014) and neural circuit tools (Simpson, 2009) to resolve the mechanisms underlying duetting. Such tools will allow us to determine, for example, if genes such as fruitless and doublesex, known to be important for the establishment of sexually dimorphic and courtship-related behaviors in melanogaster (Kimura et al., 2008), play different roles in a species in which both males and females are capable of song production. Our study also uncovered the sensory cues and putative neural mechanisms that orchestrate duetting in virilis. We can address these mechanisms by, for example, targeting neurons (via genetic methods) in virilis that are homologous to recently mapped song pathway neurons in melanogaster (von Philipsborn et al., 2011). These experiments should reveal for the first time how the function and modulation of the song motor pathway differs between males and females in a duetting species. Because virilis is separated from melanogaster by >40 million years of evolutionary time (Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007), the development of these tools should additionally provide insight into the evolution of new behaviors such as female song production. We tested D. virilis strains 15010-1051.47, 51, 09, 48, 49, and 52 (UCSD Stock Center, San Diego, CA) in our song-recording chambers. We chose strain 15010-1051.47, derived from Hangchow, China, for all experiments in this study, because both males and females of this strain produced the most song during courtship. Flies were maintained on standard medium at 20°C, on a 16-hr light:8-hr dark cycle (Suvanto et al., 1999). For behavioral assays, virgin males were housed individually, while virgin females were group housed. All flies were aged 10-20 days; this is the time required to reach sexual maturity (Isoherranen et al., 1999). Behavioral assays were performed between 0-4 hr ZT and at approximately 22°C.
Many animal species, including insects, are capable of acoustic duetting, a complex social behavior in which males and females tightly control the rate and timing of their courtship song syllables relative to each other. The mechanisms underlying duetting remain largely unknown across model systems. Most studies of duetting focus exclusively on acoustic interactions, but the use of multisensory cues should aid in coordinating behavior between individuals. To test this hypothesis, we develop Drosophila virilis as a new model for studies of duetting. By combining sensory manipulations, quantitative behavioral assays, and statistical modeling, we show that virilis females combine precisely timed auditory and tactile cues to drive song production and duetting. Tactile cues delivered to the abdomen and genitalia play the larger role in females, as even headless females continue to coordinate song production with courting males. These data, therefore, reveal a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic duetting. Finally, our results indicate that female-duetting circuits are not sexually differentiated, as males can also produce ‘female-like’ duets in a context-dependent manner.
When performing a duet, human singers listen to each other and also use other cues like tapping and nodding to keep in time. Duets are also found in the courtship rituals of some animals, but unlike human duetters—who tend to sing at the same time—the male and female animals take turns singing back and forth in quick succession. For most species, the male starts the duet and the female responds. It is thought that animals rely on their sense of hearing to perform their duets successfully, but it is not clear whether they also rely on other cues, or what these might be.
