 All organisms need to accurately assess their environment to respond to changes that impact their survival. Environmental changes such as food availability can lead to alterations in organismal physiology, such as stress resistance and metabolic states that have consequences for clinically important outputs such as disease progression, health, fecundity and lifespan (Libert and Pletcher, 2007). Many conserved genetic mechanisms that govern these alterations to physiology have been identified (Libert and Pletcher, 2007; Berthoud and Morrison, 2008; Rother et al., 2008; Alcedo et al., 2010; Koch and Horvath, 2014). Yet, how these genetic pathways encode and process information about the environment to elicit physiological outputs in vivo is unclear at a quantitative and mechanistic level, despite their importance for health and disease. During DR, lifespan increases as food levels are decreased from ad libitum conditions until reaching a maximum, beyond which further food reduction lowers lifespan (Bishop and Guarente, 2007; Mair and Dillin, 2008; Fontana et al., 2010; Alic and Partridge, 2011). To fully understand the response to food levels that C. elegans might encounter in the wild (Felix and Duveau, 2012), we modified a well-established DR protocol (Greer et al., 2007) (Figure 1A) to measure the lifespans of wildtype animals shifted as day 2 adults to 19 concentrations of the Escherichia coli food source across ∼11 orders of magnitude (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—source data 1). We inhibited progeny production with egg-5(RNAi) (Figure 1A) to prevent matricide due to internal hatching at low food levels. This treatment does not affect the lifespan response to food; similar responses were observed in wildtype animals without egg-5(RNAi) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and are found in the literature where similar subsets of food ranges were tested using other DR protocols (below).10.7554/eLife.06259.003Figure 1.Two neuronal genes, daf-7 and tph-1, shape a complex, multiphasic relationship between lifespan and food availability.(A) Protocol for maintaining animals at different food levels for lifespan and imaging experiments. Effects of initiating different dietary restriction (DR) on different days are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B. (B) Mean lifespan of wildtype worms subjected to 19 food levels ranging from 0-3.5 × 1010 bacterial cells/ml at 20°C. Points denoting key features in the food response and used as food conditions in subsequent experiments are highlighted. Figure 1—figure supplement 1D shows that these lifespan responses have similar shapes across different temperatures. The lifespan data are shown in Figure 1—source data 1. (C) Mean lifespans of wildtype and mutant animals across the six food levels indicated in (B) show that loss of tph-1 and daf-7 preserves the pattern but attenuates the range of the lifespan response. Genotypes are indicated by the legends below (E) and (F). The lifespan data are shown in Figure 1—source data 2, and statistical comparisons between the different genotypes and food levels are shown in Figure 1—source data 3. (D) tph-1 and daf-7 modulation of lifespan is bidirectional and their epistatic relationship is food-specific. The epistatic interaction between the two genes in the tph-1(−); daf-7(−) double mutant differs depending on food level. The double mutant resembled the tph-1(−) single mutant in the absence of a bacterial food source and resembled the daf-7(−) single mutant at a high bacterial food concentration. (E) Range of food-induced lifespan modulation for each genotype. Range is defined by the difference between the highest and lowest mean lifespan response across the six food levels. (F) Average of the mean lifespan responses across all food levels for each genotype reveals a consistent, food-independent baseline lifespan response. The schedule for transferring animals to different conditions in these lifespans are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.00310.7554/eLife.06259.004Figure 1—source data 1.Summary of wild type lifespan outputs under the full range of food levels tested.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.00410.7554/eLife.06259.005Figure 1—source data 2.Summary of wild type and mutant lifespan outputs under six selected food levels.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.00510.7554/eLife.06259.006Figure 1—source data 3.Statistical significance of lifespan modulation across food levels and genetic backgrounds.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.00610.7554/eLife.06259.007Figure 1—figure supplement 1.Effects of DR initiation time, temperature and egg-5(RNAi) on the lifespan response.(A) Survival curves for worms transferred from the baseline, abundant level of food (2 × 109 cells/ml) to a more limited food condition (2 × 105 cells/ml) at different days of adulthood. Different days of DR initiation result in substantial differences in survival trajectories. (B) The mean lifespan response of these worms shows lifespan extension for animals transferred on day 2 or later but a negative effect on lifespan for animals subjected to DR from day 1 of adulthood, possibly due to developmental effects. (C) Wildtype worms show a similar lifespan response to exposed different food levels in the absence of egg-5(RNAi). (D) The pattern of lifespan modulation by food abundance is maintained across the range of standard C. elegans culture temperatures. (E) Increased temperature consistently lowers mean lifespans across all food levels. (F) Increased temperature also consistently lowers the range of lifespan modulation achieved by alterations in food.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.00710.7554/eLife.06259.008Figure 1—figure supplement 2.Schedule of transfers for lifespans at different temperatures.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06259.008 We have shown that food abundance is functionally encoded in vivo in C. elegans by the combinatorial expression of tph-1 and daf-7 in three neuron pairs. Lifespan increases and decreases as a function of food abundance. The phenotypes of tph-1(−) and daf-7(−) mutants reveal that rather than serving intrinsic roles in lifespan extension, serotonin and TGFβ are signals required for bidirectional food-dependent lifespan changes (Figure 1D). This bidirectional phenotype was only revealed by analysis of lifespan across a very broad range of food levels. Many genes have been implicated in lifespan modulation or DR-related responses; a systematic analysis under additional conditions may provide new insights on their roles in food-dependent responses. That daf-7 and tph-1 act in food-responsive sensory neurons, together with the bidirectional attenuation of lifespan responses in the single and double mutants suggests that loss of tph-1 and daf-7 impairs the ability to sense and/or convey information about food levels, leading to a flattened response (Figure 1C). This interpretation is further supported by the observations that loss of daf-7 and tph-1 reduced the dynamic range of lifespan responses (Figure 1E), and lowered the accuracy of food level representation (Figure 6E,F). tph-1 and daf-7 have established functional connections to conserved pathways for regulating metabolism, cellular maintenance, reproduction and longevity, such as the insulin/IGF pathway (Liang et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2007; Narasimhan et al., 2011). Thus, this internal perception of food availability may facilitate the coordination of energy utilization and appropriate physiological and behavioral responses to optimize survival in variable environments. The following parental strains were used to generate all other used in this study: N2 (wildtype), QL101 tph-1(n4622) II, QL282 daf-7(ok3125) III, EG6701 ttTi4348 I; unc-119(ed3) III; oxEx1580, EG6699 ttTi5605 II; unc-119(ed3) III; oxEx1578. Worms were cultured according to standard protocols (Stiernagle, 2006).
How the nervous system internally represents environmental food availability is poorly understood. Here, we show that quantitative information about food abundance is encoded by combinatorial neuron-specific gene-expression of conserved TGFβ and serotonin pathway components in Caenorhabditis elegans. Crosstalk and auto-regulation between these pathways alters the shape, dynamic range, and population variance of the gene-expression responses of daf-7 (TGFβ) and tph-1 (tryptophan hydroxylase) to food availability. These intricate regulatory features provide distinct mechanisms for TGFβ and serotonin signaling to tune the accuracy of this multi-neuron code: daf-7 primarily regulates gene-expression variability, while tph-1 primarily regulates the dynamic range of gene-expression responses. This code is functional because daf-7 and tph-1 mutations bidirectionally attenuate food level-dependent changes in lifespan. Our results reveal a neural code for food abundance and demonstrate that gene expression serves as an additional layer of information processing in the nervous system to control long-term physiology.
To maximize their chances of survival, animals need to be able to sense changes in the abundance of food in their environment and respond in an appropriate manner. The nervous system is able to sense cues from the environment and coordinate responses in the whole organism, but it is not clear how this leads to long-term changes in the organism's biology.
