 Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe disorder that affects neuronal circuits involved in social behaviour and cognitive processes (Harrison and Weinberger, 2005; Lewis and Sweet, 2009). Increasing evidence suggests that different risk genes interact synergistically to contribute to SZ, mainly by affecting excitatory and/or inhibitory circuitries in the cortex (Harrison and Weinberger, 2005; Lisman et al., 2008; Lewis and Sweet, 2009; Glausier and Lewis, 2013). In particular, polymorphisms in Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) have been consistently linked to schizophrenia in different populations (Stefansson et al., 2002; Mei and Xiong, 2008). The NRG1 gene encodes more than 30 isoforms that differ in structure, expression pattern, processing and signalling modes which complicates the study of the NRG1 family (Mei and Xiong, 2008). Most Ig-Nrg1 isoforms apparently function as diffusible paracrine signals. Conversely, the cysteine-rich domain-(CRD-) containing Nrg1 isoform (also known as Type III Nrg1) is membrane bound and, in addition to canonical forward signalling via ErbB4, can also signal backward via its intracellular domain (Nrg1-ICD) (Bao et al., 2003; Mei and Xiong, 2008; Chen et al., 2010a; Pedrique and Fazzari, 2010). Converging studies demonstrate that Nrg1/ErbB4 forward signalling controls the establishment of cortical inhibitory circuits and is implicated in the control of neuronal synchronisation (Chen et al., 2010b; Fazzari et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2010; Rico and Marin, 2011; Cahill et al., 2012). However, the physiological role of CRD-Nrg1 intracellular signalling, and thus the function of the membrane bound and intracellular domain of Nrg1 remains unclear. We reasoned that the behavioural deficits observed in Aph1bc−/− mice (Dejaegere et al., 2008) could be due to abnormal development of the brain. To perform the morphometric analysis of control and Aph1bc−/− cortices, we immunolabelled control and mutant brains for Cux1, a marker for layers II/III and IV, and for the panneuronal marker NeuN (Figure 1A). We found that Aph1bc deletion did not alter the size of cortical layers or the relative distribution of neurons in different layers (Figure 1B-C). Hence, the observed behavioural abnormalities could not be attributed to a gross morphological alteration of the brain structure.10.7554/eLife.02196.003Figure 1.Normal cortical layer formation and altered expression of synaptic markers in Aph1bc−/− deficient mice.(A) Representative pictures of neuronal cortices from Control and Aph1bc−/− null mice at P30 immunostained for the upper layers marker Cux1 and for the pan neuronal marker NeuN.

Aph1bc−/− deficient brains did not show overt signs of neuronal degeneration or an alteration in neuronal layering or dendritic branching. Nonetheless, we found that the expression of excitatory synaptic markers, synaptic transmission, mEPSCs and long-term plasticity were impaired in Aph1bc−/− deficient mice. Taking advantage of conditional selective γ-secretase mutant mice, we demonstrated in neuronal cultures that Aph1bc is cell autonomously required for dendritic spine formation and that Nrg1-ICD and CRD-Nrg1-FL expression could rescue the Aph1bc loss of function phenotype. The relevance of Aph1bc-γ-secretase/Nrg1 intracellular signalling in excitatory synaptic function was further supported by the impairment in mEPSCs in Aph1bc−/− neuronal cultures which was significantly alleviated by Nrg1-ICD expression. Notably, exogenous expression of CRD-Nrg1-FL could not rescue the spine formation deficit in Aph1abc−/− neurons, which are completely devoid of γ-secretase activity (Serneels et al., 2005). Therefore, the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Nrg1 is necessary for Nrg1 rescue of spine formation. Besides, even though Aph1a-γ-secretase might redundantly contribute to Nrg1 processing, collectively our data indicate that Aph1bc-γ-secretase is the major regulator of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in this biological process. Finally, single cell Aph1bc deletion in vivo by in utero electroporation impaired spine formation and could be rescued by Nrg1-ICD expression, emphasizing the physiological relevance of our observations. Aph1afl/fl and Aph1bcfl/fl were previously described (Serneels et al., 2005). To obtain Aph1bc deficient brains for WB and IF analysis Aph1bcfl/fl mice were crossed with heterozygous Nestin driven Cre mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln/J; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), Cre negative littermates were taken as controls. To obtain homozygous and heterozygous Aph1bc null mice for electrophysiology, Aph1bcfl/fl were first crossed with Pgk driven Cre as described (Serneels et al., 2005) to obtain constitutive Aph1bc−/− that were backcrossed with wild type mice. Neuronal cultures were performed from conditional Aph1bcfl/fl embryos. All colonies were kept in C57BL/6J background and littermates were taken as controls. All experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Experimenting of the University of Leuven (KU Leuven).
Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and the γ-secretase subunit APH1B have been previously implicated as genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and schizophrenia relevant deficits have been observed in rodent models with loss of function mutations in either gene. Here we show that the Aph1b-γ-secretase is selectively involved in Nrg1 intracellular signalling. We found that Aph1b-deficient mice display a decrease in excitatory synaptic markers. Electrophysiological recordings show that Aph1b is required for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, gain and loss of function and genetic rescue experiments indicate that Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes dendritic spine formation downstream of Aph1b-γ-secretase in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the physiological role of Aph1b-γ-secretase in brain and provides a new mechanistic perspective on the relevance of NRG1 processing in schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia affects around 1% of the world's population, with symptoms including hallucinations and delusions, apathy and cognitive impairments. Multiple genes and environmental factors interact to increase the risk of schizophrenia, making the causes of the disease—which can differ between individuals—difficult to disentangle. However, Schizophrenia is known to be associated with a reduction in the number of dendritic spines, the small protrusions that allow brain cells to receive inputs from other brain cells.
