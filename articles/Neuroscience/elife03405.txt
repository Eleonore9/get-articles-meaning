 The somatosensory system and especially the highly developed mystacial whisker system is one of the most important senses used by rats to sense the external world. The rat mystacial pad contains an array of vibrissae (whiskers) that rhythmically move back and forth (whisk) to palpate the environment (Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970; Carvell and Simons, 1990). Using their whiskers, rodents can locate and distinguish objects in their immediate sensory environment (Carvell and Simons, 1990; von Heimendahl et al., 2007; Diamond et al., 2008b). Texture discrimination is one of the major sensory tasks performed by the barrel whisker system, and just a few whisker palpations are sufficient for discriminating between different texture coarseness with a high degree of sensitivity and reliability (Guic-Robles et al., 1989; Carvell and Simons, 1990). Previous studies have shown that activation of the primary barrel cortex is crucial for texture coarseness discrimination (Guic-Robles et al., 1989; Carvell and Simons, 1990; Guic-Robles et al., 1992), yet despite its importance the functional organization and texture coarseness coding in the S1 barrel cortex are largely unknown. We recorded the responses of layer 2-3 neurons during artificial whisking (Semba and Egger, 1986; Szwed et al., 2003) (‘Materials and methods’) across sandpapers with different degrees of coarseness (P120, P320, P600, and P1000) and whisking in air (free whisk-FW) while simultaneously recording calcium transients from multiple neurons bulk loaded with Fluo-4 using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) (Figure 1A-D). Sandpapers are traditionally used as a substrate of choice to investigate coarseness (Guic-Robles et al., 1989; Diamond et al., 2008b) as different sandpapers mainly differ by the average size of their particles (grit size), which are uniformly distributed across a flat surface. In experiments that included FW only three sandpapers were examined (P320, P600, and P1000) due to time limitation imposed by the dye washout observed in the AM bulk loading technique (Sato et al., 2007). To increase the temporal resolution during acquisition of calcium signals from large number of neurons, we developed a new free hand line scan routine that allowed us to retain high temporal resolution (50-100 Hz) while simultaneously recording from dozens of neurons (50.3 ± 3.4 neurons per experiment, range of 24-89 neurons per experiment, 23 rats) (‘Materials and methods’; Figure 1A). The stability of the line scan path was checked continuously during the experiment (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2). Responses were recorded from the principle barrel, as determined by intrinsic imaging during whisker deflection (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), and whisker displacements were measured by an infrared photo-sensor and a high speed camera (Flare, IO industries at 1000 fps) (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 4; Video 1). Our imaging measurements showed that the calcium transients were locked to the whisking envelopes (Figure 1B). However, the temporal resolution of our calcium measurements (up to 100 Hz) was not sufficient to detect changes resulting from individual micro movements of the whisker. To characterize the variability and reliability of the calcium and whisking responses between repeated trails, we calculated the mean and SEM of the responses in individual neurons (individual traces are shown for four neurons in Figure 1D and the average values are shown for all neurons in a single experiment in Figure 1E). Furthermore, we tracked whisker movements during artificial whisking using the fast camera (1000 Hz) (Video 1). We found little variability in the whisker angle between consecutive trails and between different trial blocks (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A), indicating robust whisker movements during artificial whisking. As expected, we did observe differences in the whisker curvature (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B) and differences in the stick and slip events between different texture coarseness (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).10.7554/eLife.03405.003Figure 1.Two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2-3 neurons evoked by artificial whisking against textures in the barrel cortex in vivo.(A) Experimental set-up. A small (2 × 2 mm) craniotomy was performed above the barrel cortex, and the dura was carefully removed. Nerve stimulation was performed with a silver hook attached electrode to the buccal nerve. Only the principle whisker was left intact while other whiskers were trimmed. Artificial whisking (10 trains at 5.5 Hz) was performed either in free air (FW) or against different sandpapers. The calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM and the astrocytic dye SR101 were injected to layer 2-3 via a glass pipette under visual control using the two-photon microscope. The right upper panel shows an image of all cells filled with Fluo-4 and the right lower panel shows the astrocytes filled with SR101 in the same field of view (260 µm from pia). Left lower panel, calcium dependent fluorescent signals were collected from cells (horizontal aspect) using the free hand line scan mode (cyan line in right upper panel) and presented as a function of time (vertical aspect). Red lines mark the stimulus time. (B) Simultaneous recordings of the fluorescent calcium signal (red) and whisker trajectory (gray and blue) recorded using an optic sensor.

Whisker movement was captured with a fast camera (1000 Hz acquisition rate) while swiping 4 different textures (upper left P1000, upper right P600, lower left P320, lower right P120).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03405.010 In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to investigate the coding and spatial organization of texture coarseness in layer 2-3 of the S1 barrel cortex. We find texture responding neurons in layer 2-3 barrel cortex with subset of neurons preferentially responding to different texture coarseness. We further find that cells with similar preferred texture coarseness are spatially clustered across layer 2-3 of the barrel cortex. It is presently unclear whether these neurons code for the complex entity of coarseness or alternatively code for another more basic physical feature such as velocity of the whisker, grain sharpness, grain size, frequency etc. Regardless of the answer to this important question it is clear that texture coarseness can be decoded from the activity of these neurons irrespective of the exact physical entity they code for. These findings were shown in two different whisker activation paradigms, artificial whisking against different texture coarseness and passive replay of texture-like vibrations. The manner by which whiskers are activated is critical for the experiments. There is no ‘perfect’ way to repeatedly activate the whisker system in a robust and behaviorally relevant manner. Behaving rats performing texture discrimination tasks are of course most physiologically relevant, yet multiple well-controlled robust repetitions are very hard to obtain. On the other side of the spectrum passive whisker movements in anesthetized rodents are very well controlled and robust; yet probably differ from the physiological whisker activation. Artificial whisking in anesthetized animals is an intermediate whisker activation paradigm however receptor activation may deviate from that occurring under physiological whisking. It is important to note that a recent report shows that the kinematics of the whisker movement during artificial whisking closely simulates that of freely behaving rats (Bagdasarian et al., 2013). In our experiments both passive whisker activation and artificial whisking yielded similar results, reinforcing our main conclusion that texture selective neurons clustered across the S1 barrel cortex. It is however important to stress that in our experiments, rats were anesthetized; and in future, the findings should be corroborated in behaving animals. It is interesting to note that texture responding neurons were detected in barrel cortex of awake behaving mice during a texture discrimination paradigm (Chen et al., 2013). Wistar rats (male P27-35) were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal urethane (1.5 gr/kg body weight). After exposing the skull a stainless steel frame was attached to the bone using dental acrylic cement. A 2 × 2 mm wide craniotomy was opened above the barrel cortex and the dura was carefully removed. Brain pulsations were reduced by filling the craniotomy with 1.2% agarose in ACSF solution and covering with immobilized coverslip. The exposed cortex was super fused with normal rat ringer's solution. Body temperature was maintained at 36-37°C using a heating blanket (FHC). For the artificial whisking stimulation, the buccal branch of the facial nerve was exposed and cut at its proximal end (Semba and Egger, 1986).
Texture discrimination is a fundamental function of somatosensory systems, yet the manner by which texture is coded and spatially represented in the barrel cortex are largely unknown. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the rat barrel cortex during artificial whisking against different surface coarseness or controlled passive whisker vibrations simulating different coarseness, we show that layer 2-3 neurons within barrel boundaries differentially respond to specific texture coarsenesses, while only a minority of neurons responded monotonically with increased or decreased surface coarseness. Neurons with similar preferred texture coarseness were spatially clustered. Multi-contact single unit recordings showed a vertical columnar organization of texture coarseness preference in layer 2-3. These findings indicate that layer 2-3 neurons perform high hierarchical processing of tactile information, with surface coarseness embodied by distinct neuronal subpopulations that are spatially mapped onto the barrel cortex.
As nocturnal tunnel-dwelling animals, rats rely on their whiskers to enable them to navigate in the dark. By moving their whiskers back and forth in movements called whisking, rats can obtain detailed information about the shape, texture, and size of objects in their path and also work out whether they can fit through narrow gaps.
