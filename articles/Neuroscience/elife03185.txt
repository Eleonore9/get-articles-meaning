 Rats are highly social animals that display complex behaviors (aggression, dominance, mating, parental care, and play [Barnett, 1958]), which involve the use of multi-modal signaling and sensing (Brecht and Freiwald, 2012). These social interactions are initially characterized by anogenital sniffing followed by facial contacts which occur at a constant rate (Wolfe et al., 2011). Facial contacts have also been shown to be involved in dominance-related behaviors in naturalistic settings (Blanchard et al., 2001). Facial contacts consist of extensive whisker-to-whisker and snout-to-snout touch episodes, largely mediated by macrovibrissae (Wolfe et al., 2011). The use of macrovibrissae results in a strong activation of the barrel cortex and, importantly, the neurons appear to represent the social context of these interactions by distinct firing rates (Bobrov et al., 2014). To study the neuronal representation of multisensory signaling during social interactions in the gap paradigm (Figure 1A), we combined low- and high-speed videography with acoustic and neuronal data acquisition. Rats engaged in extensive facial touch that involved whisker-to-whisker (n = 2894, Figure 1B, left) and snout-to-snout contacts (n = 2232, Figure 1B, right) with social and non-social stimuli (i.e., conspecifics and objects/plastinated rats, respectively). The interactions were spontaneous, frequent (1.76 events/min), and usually sustained (2.86 ± 2.68 s, mean ± SD; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, Video 1). A total of 56,525 USVs were identified and classified into categories described earlier for rats in a social context (Wright et al., 2010), that is, trill, complex, flat (Figure 1C), upward ramp, downward ramp, inverted u, split, and short (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). A few fear calls were also observed but these were restricted to two animals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Analysis of call properties revealed characteristic mean frequencies, bandwidths, and call durations (Table 1). Intensity measurements from the four microphones were used to assign a source to the majority of USVs (80%). Analysis of false positive rates estimated that >4 out of 5 calls were correctly assigned to the source (see ‘Materials and methods’).10.7554/eLife.03185.003Figure 1.Facial touch is associated with increased ultrasonic vocalizations.(A) Social interactions between subject and stimulus rats placed across a gap were documented using low- (30 Hz) and high-speed (250 Hz) cameras under infra-red (IR) illumination. USVs were recorded using four ultrasound microphones. (B) Facial touch consists of whisker (left) and snout contacts (right). Whisker tracking was facilitated by the use of tags (red circle; t0 = time of first whisker contact).

In addition, ultrasonic vocalizations produced by the subject rat (left) are shown as spectrograms (slowed down by a factor of 16, top panel). The stimulus animal (right) was anaesthetized to remove confounds of the source of sound. Whiskers of the subject rat were tracked and whisking angles were calculated. A trace of the whisking angle indicates protraction (positive angles) and retraction (negative angles, middle panel). Onsets of individual ultrasonic vocalizations are indicated as vertical rasters in the whisker trace, indicating that vocalization and whisking appear to be temporally coordinated, with a bias towards the retraction phase of the whiskers.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03185.00510.7554/eLife.03185.006Table 1.Properties of USV categories emitted during social interactions.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03185.006Call typenFrequency (kHz)Band width (kHz)Duration (ms)Mean± SEM20th, 80th quantilesMean± SEM20th, 80th quantilesMean± SEM20th, 80th quantilesTrill16,54963.10.251.7, 76.910.30.15.1, 12.650.90.230.2, 67.1Complex13,66254.80.148.1, 62.97.80.13.9, 8.739.00.223.8, 49.9Flat13,65649.00.138.6, 56.05.20.12.7, 5.344.10.321.7, 56.4Upward ramp128051.60.445.7, 59.86.50.23.5, 8.426.80.315.9, 36.5Downward ramp25848.01.031.7, 59.75.50.43.2, 6.819.90.811.6, 25.6Inverted u50155.50.745.0, 67.45.70.23.2, 7.216.40.511.0, 18.4Short2649.63.136.1, 65.14.10.33.1, 5.413.70.910.9, 15.6Split107245.20.534.0, 57.27.40.53.1, 7.368.11.438.9, 87.8Fear call29928.00.522.9, 31.02.40.51.1, 2.3206.516.630.2, 353.7 Social interactions consist of complex behaviors which employ a range of multi-modal signaling and sensing (Brecht and Freiwald, 2012). Social transmission of food preference which relies on the combined use of olfactory and gustatory cues (Galef and Wigmore, 1983) is probably the most extensively studied example of this. In addition, the use of unimodal signals including vision (ear wiggling [Erskine, 1989]), smell (cheek gland pheromones, [Kannan and Archunan, 2001], and somatosensation [Blanchard et al., 2001]) has also been reported. However, little is known about the multisensory integration of these signals, which would play a critical role in facilitating social interactions. In this inquiry, we study interacting rats to investigate audio-haptic coordination and multisensory integration in the auditory cortex. We demonstrate that facial touch during social interactions is associated with an increased production of USVs. We observe a temporal coordination of vocalization and whisking, with calls being associated with the retraction of whiskers. USVs elicited excitatory responses in a small fraction of RS neurons in the auditory cortex, whereas almost all FS neurons showed a strong activation. Facial touch however resulted in a robust inhibition of the primary auditory cortex. Moreover, we observed a remarkable off-response at the end of the touch episode, possibly reflecting a release of touch-induced inhibition, which was surprisingly the largest response modulation observed in our study. Finally, it appears that the response of auditory cortex neurons to USVs is modulated by facial touch. Wistar rats (45- to 60-day old, female and male) were commercially procured (Harlan, Eystrup, Germany) and housed with a 12:12 hr inverted light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. While implanted (‘subject’) rats were housed individually after surgery, ‘stimulus’ rats were housed in groups of 2-3. After a 1-week post shipment recovery, rats were handled for 2-3 days, following which they were habituated to the behavioral setup for 3-4 days. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance to German regulations on animal welfare (Permit no. G0259/09).
Social interactions involve multi-modal signaling. Here, we study interacting rats to investigate audio-haptic coordination and multisensory integration in the auditory cortex. We find that facial touch is associated with an increased rate of ultrasonic vocalizations, which are emitted at the whisking rate (∼8 Hz) and preferentially initiated in the retraction phase of whisking. In a small subset of auditory cortex regular-spiking neurons, we observed excitatory and heterogeneous responses to ultrasonic vocalizations. Most fast-spiking neurons showed a stronger response to calls. Interestingly, facial touch-induced inhibition in the primary auditory cortex and off-responses after termination of touch were twofold stronger than responses to vocalizations. Further, touch modulated the responsiveness of auditory cortex neurons to ultrasonic vocalizations. In summary, facial touch during social interactions involves precisely orchestrated calling-whisking patterns. While ultrasonic vocalizations elicited a rather weak population response from the regular spikers, the modulation of neuronal responses by facial touch was remarkably strong.
Rats are highly social creatures, preferring to live in large groups within an established hierarchy. Social interactions range from play, mating, and parental care to displays of aggression and dominance and involve the use of odors, touch, and vocal calls. Touch typically takes the form of snout-to-snout contact, while most vocalizations are ultrasonic, with calls of different frequencies used to signal alarm or pleasure.
