 Signaling via G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) mediates neurotransmitter actions and shapes many essential neuronal processes including vision, motor control, and cognition (Wettschureck and Offermanns, 2005). In addition to tremendous diversity in neurotransmitter receptors and the neuronal responses they modulate, GPCR pathways can be tuned in terms of response magnitude, sensitivity, and kinetics, oftentimes creating characteristic signature profiles specifically suited to meet the signaling demands of a neuronal circuit (Marder, 2012; Nusbaum and Blitz, 2012). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of specific signaling patterns, their relationship to synaptic processing, and ultimately to behavior remain poorly understood. While elimination of either RGS7 or RGS11 alone does not substantially alter depolarizing activity of ON-BCs (Mojumder et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010), simultaneous loss of both proteins completely abolishes the responses of these cells to light flashes (Cao et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2012). In an effort to achieve an intermediate state of RGS expression we studied mice where elimination of one RGS is combined with the haploinsufficiency of the other (e.g., Rgs11−/−: Rgs7+/− or Rgs11+/−: Rgs7−/−). Evaluation of these mouse models by both electroretinography (ERG) and single cell recordings from rod ON-BCs revealed largely normal responses, that showed only minor delays in the onset time of the ERG b-wave (Figure 1; Table 1). Thus, normal depolarizing activity of ON-BCs is supported by a relatively low concentration of the RGS proteins.10.7554/eLife.06358.003Figure 1.Effects of RGS haploinsufficiency on ON-BC properties.(A) Representative electroretinography (ERG) traces of RGS11 knockout (Rgs11−/−), RGS7 knockout (Rgs7−/−) alone or in combination with haploinsufficiency of the other (Rgs11−/−, Rgs7+/− and Rgs11+/−, Rgs7−/−).

These signals may vary in their temporal characteristics, sensitivity thresholds, and throughput bandwidth to ultimately match physiological demands (Marder, 2012). GPCR signaling pathways play a key role in setting many circuit parameters as they mediate effects of a vast number of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (Nusbaum and Blitz, 2012). However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that shape signaling and their relationship to behavioral outcomes is rather limited. Generation of mice with the constitutive deletion in Rgs7 (Rgs7−/−) (Cao et al., 2012), Rgs11 (Rgs11−/−) (Cao et al., 2008), or both (DKO) (Cao et al., 2012) was previously described. Conditional targeting of RGS7 was achieved by flanking exon 4 with LoxP sites (Rgs7flx/flx) (Cao et al., 2012). The resulting mice were crossed with Rgs11−/− line to generate cDKO:Cre- strain (Rgs11−/−: Rgs7flx/flx), and further with a Cre driver line ubiquitously expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ERT2 recombinase B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-cre/Esr1*)5Amc/J to produce cDKO:Cre+ mice (Rgs11−/−: Rgs7flx/flx: CAG-CreERT2). To induce Cre expression 20 mg/kg tamoxifen (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), dissolved in corn oil and 10% ethanol, was administered by oral gavage with an 18-24 gauge smooth tip needle. Tamoxifen was administered once daily for 5 consecutive days. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and were granted formal approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Scripps Research Institute (IACUC protocol number 14-001), Washington University (IACUC protocol number 20140236), and the University of Southern California (IACUC protocol number 10890).
In the retina, synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and downstream ON-bipolar neurons (ON-BCs) is mediated by a GPCR pathway, which plays an essential role in vision. However, the mechanisms that control signal transmission at this synapse and its relevance to behavior remain poorly understood. In this study we used a genetic system to titrate the rate of GPCR signaling in ON-BC dendrites by varying the concentration of key RGS proteins and measuring the impact on transmission of signal between photoreceptors and ON-BC neurons using electroretinography and single cell recordings. We found that sensitivity, onset timing, and the maximal amplitude of light-evoked responses in rod- and cone-driven ON-BCs are determined by different RGS concentrations. We further show that changes in RGS concentration differentially impact visually guided-behavior mediated by rod and cone ON pathways. These findings illustrate that neuronal circuit properties can be modulated by adjusting parameters of GPCR-based neurotransmission at individual synapses.
At the back of the eye, a structure called the retina contains several types of cell that convert light into the electrical signals that the brain interprets to produce vision. Cells called rods and cones detect the light, and then signal to other neurons in the retina that relay this information to the brain. Rods and cones are specialized to respond best to different visual features: cones detect color and can track rapid movement; whereas rods are more sensitive to low light levels and so enable night vision.
