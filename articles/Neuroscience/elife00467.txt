 Across the animal kingdom, appropriate defensive behavior is key to survival. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the brain has evolved multiple circuits to control such behaviors. For example, studies in rodents have led to the conclusion that there are multiple, anatomically distinct pathways controlling learned (conditioned) and innate defensive responses (reviewed in [Rosen, 2004; LeDoux, 2012] but see [Cezario et al., 2008; Martinez et al., 2011; Gross and Canteras, 2012]). In these pathways, sensory inputs converge on the amygdala, whose output is relayed by the hypothalamus to downstream structures that control the defensive response. However, different subdivisions of the amygdala and hypothalamus are thought to control learned vs innate responses, in a parallel manner (Figure 1A; reviewed in [Davis, 1992; Fanselow, 1994; LeDoux, 1995, 2000; Gallagher and Chiba, 1996; Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999; Canteras, 2002; Rosen, 2004; Swanson, 2005; Gross and Canteras, 2012; LeDoux, 2012; Saper and Lowell, 2014]).10.7554/eLife.06633.003Figure 1.Characterization of SF1+ neurons and their optogenetic activation.(A) Schematic illustrating brain circuits involved in defensive behaviors.

Data were collected using serial two-photon tomography (Ragan et al., 2012) and deposited in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (http://connectivity.brain-map.org). Source experiment: Nr5a1-Cre:VMH-LHA, Experiment 114290225 (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/?searchMode=source&sourceDomain=693&primaryStructureOnly=true&transgenicLines=177839331&initImage=TWO_PHOTON&experimentCoordinates=7100,6800,6200&experiment=114290225). Data were imported into Brain Explorer 2 (http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/brainexplorer), for computational reconstruction in 3D. Data were filtered to show the highest-density/highest intensity projections. Projection targets (green) and associated coronal sections from the Allen Brain Atlas (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/?searchMode=source&sourceDomain=693&primaryStructureOnly=true&transgenicLines=177839331&initImage=TWO_PHOTON&experimentCoordinates=7100,6800,6200&experiment=114290225) were identified by sampling terminals in high-density target sites, following which a volumetric rendering of relevant target structure was computationally superimposed on the projection map. A subset of the highest-density projection targets is illustrated. Individual panels are shown in slightly different 3D orientations to more clearly illustrate the pattern of projections to the indicated structure. The relative orientation of the entire brain in each panel can be viewed in the 3D volumetric model illustrated in the top right corner of each panel. Upper left panel depicts the VMH (injection site). Remaining panels depict the following projection sites: AHN, BNST, LHA, MeA, PAG. These illustrations are presented in accordance with AIBS policy and citation guidelines (see http://www.alleninstitute.org/terms-of-use/ and http://www.alleninstitute.org/citation-policy/). These projection profiles can be viewed in 3D here in these two supplemental Videos (Video 9, 10). Projections from Nr5a1+ neurons in VMH to the following structures are labeled: AHN (orange), CeA (blue-grey), CoA (turquoise), LHA (red), MeA (pale blue), PAG (violet), LA (green).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06633.004 Neurons that express the gene Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group a (Nr5a1), which is also referred to as Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) (Dhillon et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2013) constitute about 60% of cells in VMHdm/c, and are not found in other hypothalamic or amygdalar regions (www.brain-map.org, Nr5a1 in situ hybridization data). Double-labeling indicated that these neurons are essentially non-overlapping with subjacent VMHvl neurons mediating social behaviors such as aggression (Yang et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014) (Figure 1C-F). To express different effectors in these neurons, we obtained a BAC transgenic mouse line that expresses Cre-recombinase under SF1 regulatory elements (SF1-Cre) (Dhillon et al., 2006). We validated Cre-specific recombination in SF1+ neurons by injecting stereotaxically, into the VMHdm/c of SF1-Cre mice, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a Cre-dependent mCherry reporter, and double labeling with an anti-SF1 antibody (Figure 1G-J). This analysis indicated that 80% of mCherry-expressing neurons were SF1+, while little expression was observed in VMHvl (Figure 1K-N). Defensive behaviors are prototypic emotional behaviors, but the relationship between the circuits that control such behaviors, and those that encode associated emotion states such as ‘fear’, (Adolphs, 2013) remains an open question. Here we have used optogenetic manipulations to probe the behavioral function of a genetically defined, highly specific and anatomically restricted hypothalamic neuronal subpopulation (Dhillon et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2013). Our results indicate that this population controls defensive behaviors in a manner which suggests that it implements an underlying causative emotion state (Anderson and Adolphs, 2014). These experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee (IACUC) at the California Institute of Technology (protocol number 1602, 1600 and 1552).
Defensive behaviors reflect underlying emotion states, such as fear. The hypothalamus plays a role in such behaviors, but prevailing textbook views depict it as an effector of upstream emotion centers, such as the amygdala, rather than as an emotion center itself. We used optogenetic manipulations to probe the function of a specific hypothalamic cell type that mediates innate defensive responses. These neurons are sufficient to drive multiple defensive actions, and required for defensive behaviors in diverse contexts. The behavioral consequences of activating these neurons, moreover, exhibit properties characteristic of emotion states in general, including scalability, (negative) valence, generalization and persistence. Importantly, these neurons can also condition learned defensive behavior, further refuting long-standing claims that the hypothalamus is unable to support emotional learning and therefore is not an emotion center. These data indicate that the hypothalamus plays an integral role to instantiate emotion states, and is not simply a passive effector of upstream emotion centers.
Animals have evolved a large number of ‘defensive behaviors’ to deal with the threat of predators. Examples include reptiles camouflaging themselves to avoid discovery, fish and birds swarming to confuse predators, insects releasing toxic chemicals, and humans readying themselves to fight or flee.
