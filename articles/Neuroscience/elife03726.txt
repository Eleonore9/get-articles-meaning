 Understanding how neural circuits process information requires knowing not only the neuroanatomical connectivity and electrophysiological properties of individual neurons, but also the organization of synapses between specific neuronal types. Knowledge of these basic organizational principles, as well as the mechanisms for how they are achieved in a complex circuit, represents a critical goal for neuroscience. Historically, neuromuscular junctions have been model synapses for mechanistic studies because of their ease of access (Keshishian et al., 1996; Sanes and Lichtman, 1999). However, neuromuscular circuits display less complexity compared to neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS). Serial-section electron microscopy (EM) has offered remarkable resolution in studying CNS synapses in the context of circuits, including the entire Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system (White et al., 1986), the mouse olfactory bulb (Hinds and Hinds, 1976a, 1976b), retina (Briggman et al., 2011; Helmstaedter et al., 2013), and visual cortex (Bock et al., 2011), and the Drosophila visual system (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991; Takemura et al., 2013). However, these approaches are labor intensive and not easily amenable to analysis following genetic perturbation, at varying developmental stages, or with intact samples. Indeed, even for well-known synaptic organizers like Neurexin and Neuroligin (Chia et al., 2013), studies investigating their function were rarely carried out in an intact system with a resolution sufficient to reveal their detailed functions in synaptogenesis between defined neuronal types. As such, there is a need to examine CNS synapses in the intact brain, at the level of light microscopy in a system with sufficient complexity to reflect features of the CNS, but tractable enough to dissect connectivity and function using genetic tools. Current work in Drosophila has sought to fulfill this need (Kremer et al., 2010; Christiansen et al., 2011; Berger-Muller et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). To visualize synapses in vivo in genetically identifiable cells, we explored strategies to label active zones, sites of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (Zhai and Bellen, 2004). In Drosophila, the primary unit of active zone architecture is an electron dense structure called the T-bar, a specialized formation that promotes vesicle docking and release (Wichmann and Sigrist, 2010) present at peripheral (Jia et al., 1993) and central synapses (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991; Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006). The major structural components of the T-bar include Bruchpilot (Brp) and Rim-binding protein (Wagh et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2011), with Brp encoding the ‘table-top’ of the T-bar and Rim-binding protein comprising the ‘pedestal’ (Figure 1A). Widely used monoclonal antibodies (nc82) against Brp (Blanco Redondo et al., 2013) label synaptic neuropil and discrete puncta corresponding to active zones (Wagh et al., 2006). However, these antibodies cannot distinguish synapses formed by a given class of neurons in complex CNS circuits. Therefore, to visualize active zones in genetically identifiable cells, we sought to label Brp with the GAL4/UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993).10.7554/eLife.03726.003Figure 1.Measuring CNS synapses using Bruchpilot-Short.(A) Diagram comparing full-length Bruchpilot and Bruchpilot-Short. Numbers denote amino acids and orange represents coiled coil regions (after Wagh et al., 2006). The positions of Brp and Brp-Short in relation to known active zone proteins are also shown in a simplified format (after Liu et al., 2011). (B-D) High magnification confocal stacks of a single DA1 glomerulus with putative synapses labeled by Brp-Short (B), neurites labeled by mCD8-GFP (C), and the merge (D). Insets show higher magnification of a single optical section to demonstrate the punctate nature of Brp-Short-mStraw. (E-G) Screenshots of three-dimensional renderings show conversion of Brp-Short into ‘Spots’ (E) and mCD8-GFP into a volumetric surface rendering (F). For (F) and (G), the transparency of the surface rendering is at 60% to highlight internal structure and make Brp-Short puncta visible. (H) Quantification of Brp-Short puncta (red, left axis) and neurite volume (black, right axis) in males and females for five ORN classes. Statistical comparisons between males and females of a single genotype were done by student's t test. Significance across all genotypes for density was assessed with a one-way ANOVA and corrected for multiple comparisons by a posthoc Tukey's multiple comparisons test. ***p < 0.001. In all cases, n ≥ 9 brains, 18 antennal lobes for each genotype. (I) Quantification of synaptic density (Brp-Short puncta/volume of neurites) in males (blue) and females (pink) for five ORN classes. Despite considerable differences in Brp-Short puncta number, all classes of ORNs display nearly identical synaptic densities.

Scale bar = 5 μm.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03726.005 Understanding the development and organization of synapses between identified neurons within complex circuits in the brain represents a major goal of neuroscience. To address these questions, techniques are needed to visualize synapses at the light microscopy level in an intact system that is amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, we identify parameters that govern synapse number, density, and subcellular organization using two fluorescently-tagged synaptic proteins expressed from single transgenes in combination with high-resolution confocal microscopy and image processing to visualize synapses in the Drosophila olfactory system in vivo. We demonstrate that these methods are amenable to analysis in both individual neuronal classes and individual neurons. Our study provides a synapse-level analysis of innervation of olfactory receptor neurons, projection neurons, and local interneurons in the antennal lobe, which has emerged as a model circuit for analyzing principles of information processing (Wang, 2012; Wilson, 2013; Twick et al., 2014). Finally, using these synaptic tagging assays, we show that the Teneurins are required for the proper synapse number in ORNs and PNs as well as the structure of the active zones themselves. This reveals a critical role for these transmembrane proteins in organizing central synapses, likely by regulating the cytoskeleton. These approaches can be broadly used to study synaptic organization of neurons for which genetic access is available, and to investigate the functions of any other proteins in the organization and development of CNS synapses. The following GAL4 driver lines were used to restrict expression to individual classes of neurons: AM29-GAL4 (DL4 and DM6 ORNs; Endo et al., 2007), Or47b-GAL4 (VA1lm ORNs; Vosshall et al., 2000), Or67d-GAL4 (DA1 ORNs; Kurtovic et al., 2007), Or88a-GAL4 (VA1d ORNs; Vosshall et al., 2000), Mz19-GAL4 (DA1, DC3, and VA1d PNs; Jefferis et al., 2004), Pebbled-GAL4 (all ORNs; Sweeney et al., 2007), LN5(NP3056)-GAL4 (∼50 pan-glomerular LNs; Chou et al., 2010). The GH146-QF line (Potter et al., 2010) was used to genetically access 2/3 of all PNs. The following transgenes were used for labeling or genetic manipulation: UAS-Brp-Short-mStraw (Fouquet et al., 2009), UAS-Brp-Short-EGFP (Schmid et al., 2008), UAS-Dα7-GFP (Leiss et al., 2009b), UAS-3xHA-mtdT (Potter et al., 2010), UAS-mCD8-GFP (Lee and Luo, 1999), UAS-DSyd1-EGFP (Owald et al., 2010), UAS-α-spectrin-dsRNA (Pielage et al., 2005), UAS-β-spectrin-dsRNA (Pielage et al., 2005), UAS-Ten-a (Mosca et al., 2012), UAS-Brp-IR-104422 (Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center), UAS-Dcr2 (Dietzl et al., 2007), UAS-ten-a-RNAi-V32482, UAS-ten-m-RNAi-V51173 (Hong et al., 2012; Mosca et al., 2012), QUAS-mCD8-GFP (Potter et al., 2010), QUAS-Ten-a (Hong et al., 2012), and QUAS-Brp-Short-mStraw (see below). The Df (X) ten-a line was used as a ten-a null mutant (Hong et al., 2012).
Understanding information flow through neuronal circuits requires knowledge of their synaptic organization. In this study, we utilized fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic markers to map synaptic organization in the Drosophila antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) produce a constant synaptic density across different glomeruli. Each ORN within a class contributes nearly identical active zone number. Active zones from ORNs, projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons have distinct subglomerular and subcellular distributions. The correct number of ORN active zones and PN acetylcholine receptor clusters requires the Teneurins, conserved transmembrane proteins involved in neuromuscular synapse organization and synaptic partner matching. Ten-a acts in ORNs to organize presynaptic active zones via the spectrin cytoskeleton. Ten-m acts in PNs autonomously to regulate acetylcholine receptor cluster number and transsynaptically to regulate ORN active zone number. These studies advanced our ability to assess synaptic architecture in complex CNS circuits and their underlying molecular mechanisms.
Just as progress in science relies on researchers communicating their findings to other people working in their field, our bodies rely on neurons being able to communicate with other neurons. This is where structures called synapses come in: synapses allow signals to be passed from one neuron to another. Neurons and synapses process information by forming circuits in the brain, but relatively little is known about how synapses develop or how they are organized within circuits.
