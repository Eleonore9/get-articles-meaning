 In the mammalian CNS, most excitatory neurotransmission takes place at spiny synapses, and our understanding of the mechanisms that control the density and strength of excitatory glutamatergic synapses remains incomplete. Many synaptogenic molecules have been identified that can induce pre- or postsynaptic differentiation (Allen and Barres, 2005; Shen and Cowan, 2010; Siddiqui and Craig, 2011; de Wit et al., 2011). Much less is known, however, about molecular players that prevent formation of supernumerary spine synapses (Chung and Barres, 2012; Mironova and Giger, 2013). Precise regulation of CNS synapse density is critical for proper brain function and mental health, and imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (Penzes et al., 2011). Sema5A and Sema5B are expressed in the rodent hippocampus (Simmons et al., 1998; O'Connor et al., 2009). To augment these data, we conducted a detailed analysis of Sema5A expression in the postnatal hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) using a Sema5A reporter mouse expressing nuclear lacZ (Gunn et al., 2011). In the P18 and P30 hippocampus, strong β-gal activity is observed in the granule cell layer (GCL), the hilus and in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Moderate-to-strong β-gal activity is also observed in deep EC layers (Figure 1A), however more superficial EC layers, including layer II/III neurons that give rise to the perforant path, do not show Sema5A promoter activity. In situ hybridization for Sema5A revealed a similar expression pattern (Figure 1B). Sema5B expression in the postnatal hippocampus is largely confined to the DG subgranular zone (SGZ). Subcellular fractionation of hippocampal tissue revealed that Sema5A protein is present in synaptic and extra-synaptic membrane fractions and is enriched in detergent-resistant post-synaptic density (PSD) fractions. Sema5B is enriched postsynaptically and only found in the PSDIII fraction (Figure 1C).10.7554/eLife.04390.003Figure 1.Sema5A, but not Sema5B, negatively regulates dendritic spine density of hippocampal GCs in vivo.(A) Horizontal sections through the hippocampus of Sema5ALacZ/+ brains show robust β-gal activity in the GCL at P18 and P30.

Scale bar = 1 µm.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04390.005 We demonstrate here that Sema5A is a novel inhibitor of excitatory synapse formation and AMPA-type synaptic transmission. In the mouse hippocampus, Sema5A negatively regulates dendritic spine density in both developmentally born and adult-born dentate GCs. Loss of Sema5A-PlexA2 signaling results in the formation of supernumerary dendritic spines, exuberant excitatory synapses, and an increase in amplitude and frequency of excitatory synaptic transmission. Sema5A and PlexA2 are co-expressed in GCs and can both function cell-autonomously to prevent the formation of exuberant spine synapses. The rasGAP activity in the PlexA2 cytoplasmic domain is required for Sema5A-mediated inhibition of dendritic spine density. Sema5A−/− congenic mice show normal locomotion and no evidence for elevated fear or anxiety. However, the loss of Sema5A leads to deficiencies in sociability. Collectively, these results suggest that intradendritic semaphorin-plexin interactions inhibit synapse density and synaptic transmission, and when perturbed, the absence of this signaling pathway leads to impaired social behavior, a hallmark of ASD. All mice used in this study were housed and cared for in accordance with NIH guidelines, and all research conducted was done with the approval of the University of Michigan Medical School and The Johns Hopkins University Committees on Use and Care of Animals. Sema5A−/−, Sema5A(flox/flox), Sema5B−/−, Plxna1−/−, Plxna2−/−, Plxna3−/−, and Thy1-GFPm mice were previously described (Feng et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001; Yoshida et al., 2006; Matsuoka et al., 2011). Sema5Atm1Dgen/J mice express nuclear β-galactosidase (β-gal) under the control of the Sema5A promoter (Sema5AlacZ) (Gunn et al., 2011) and were purchased from Jackson Labs. For behavioral studies, Sema5A mice were backcrossed onto a C57Bl/6 background using the speed congenic services provided by Charles River. Male mice used for behavioral studies were >99% congenic, as assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis (Charles River).
Human SEMAPHORIN 5A (SEMA5A) is an autism susceptibility gene; however, its function in brain development is unknown. In this study, we show that mouse Sema5A negatively regulates synaptogenesis in early, developmentally born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (GCs). Sema5A is strongly expressed by GCs and regulates dendritic spine density in a cell-autonomous manner. In the adult mouse brain, newly born Sema5A−/− GCs show an increase in dendritic spine density and increased AMPA-type synaptic responses. Sema5A signals through PlexinA2 co-expressed by GCs, and the PlexinA2-RasGAP activity is necessary to suppress spinogenesis. Like Sema5A−/− mutants, PlexinA2−/− mice show an increase in GC glutamatergic synapses, and we show that Sema5A and PlexinA2 genetically interact with respect to GC spine phenotypes. Sema5A−/− mice display deficits in social interaction, a hallmark of autism-spectrum-disorders. These experiments identify novel intra-dendritic Sema5A/PlexinA2 interactions that inhibit excitatory synapse formation in developmentally born and adult-born GCs, and they provide support for SEMA5A contributions to autism-spectrum-disorders.
Neurons communicate with one another at specialized junctions called synapses. There are two types of synapses, called excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses, and the density and strength of both are tightly regulated because small deviations from the normal density and/or strength may lead to illness. For example, an excess of excitatory synapses has been observed in patients who have autism spectrum disorders and exhibit difficulties in social interaction.
